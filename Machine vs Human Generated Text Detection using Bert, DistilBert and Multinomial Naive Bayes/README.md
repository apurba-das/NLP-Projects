# COMP6781 Project: Comparative Analysis of Multinomial Naive Bayes and BERT in Detecting Human vs. Machine-Generated Text

This project compares Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes (MNB) and BERT-based models (BERT and DistilBERT) for detecting human vs. machine-generated text using the SemEval Task 8 and GenAI datasets. The task is complex, requiring models to identify nuanced features between human and machine text. Evaluation focuses on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results show that BERT-based models outperform MNB, though MNB still captures some patterns effectively. DistilBERT offers a more efficient alternative to BERT. Hyperparameter tuning plays a critical role in optimizing performance.
