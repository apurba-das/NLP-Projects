              "'[ emma by jane austen 1816 ] volume i chapter i emma woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her . she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister \\' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period . her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection . sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr . woodhouse \\' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of emma . between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters . even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming miss taylor \\' s judgment , but directed chiefly by her own . the real evils , indeed , of emma \\' s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments . the danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her . sorrow came -- a gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness .-- miss taylor married . it was miss taylor \\' s loss which first brought grief . it was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance . the wedding over , and the bride - people gone , her father and herself were left to dine together , with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening . her father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as usual , and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost . the event had every promise of happiness for her friend . mr . weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self - denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning \\' s work for her . the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day . she recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood . a large debt of gratitude was owing here ; but the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed isabella \\' s marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection . she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault . how was she to bear the change ?-- it was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs . weston , only half a mile from them , and a miss taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude . she dearly loved her father , but he was no companion for her . he could not meet her in conversation , rational or playful . the evil of the actual disparity in their ages ( and mr . woodhouse had not married early ) was much increased by his constitution and habits ; for having been a valetudinarian all his life , without activity of mind or body , he was a much older man in ways than in years ; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper , his talents could not have recommended him at any time . her sister , though comparatively but little removed by matrimony , being settled in london , only sixteen miles off , was much beyond her daily reach ; and many a long october and november evening must be struggled through at hartfield , before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband , and their little children , to fill the house , and give her pleasant society again . highbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals . the woodhouses were first in consequence there . all looked up to them . she had many acquaintance in the place , for her father was universally civil , but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day . it was a melancholy change ; and emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful . his spirits required support . he was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind . matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter \\' s marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield . emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could , to keep him from such thoughts ; but when tea came , it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner , \" poor miss taylor !-- i wish she were here again . what a pity it is that mr . weston ever thought of her !\" \" i cannot agree with you , papa ; you know i cannot . mr . weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife ;-- and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ?\" \" a house of her own !-- but where is the advantage of a house of her own ? this is three times as large .-- and you have never any odd humours , my dear .\" \" how often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us !-- we shall be always meeting ! _we_ must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon .\" \" my dear , how am i to get so far ? randalls is such a distance . i could not walk half so far .\" \" no , papa , nobody thought of your walking . we must go in the carriage , to be sure .\" \" the carriage ! but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way ;-- and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ?\" \" they are to be put into mr . weston \\' s stable , papa . you know we have settled all that already . we talked it all over with mr . weston last night . and as for james , you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls , because of his daughter \\' s being housemaid there . i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else . that was your doing , papa . you got hannah that good place . nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her -- james is so obliged to you !\" \" i am very glad i did think of her . it was very lucky , for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account ; and i am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; i have a great opinion of her . whenever i see her , she always curtseys and asks me how i do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , i observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it . i am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see . whenever james goes over to see his daughter , you know , she will be hearing of us . he will be able to tell her how we all are .\" emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her own . the backgammon - table was placed ; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary . mr . knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of isabella \\' s husband . he lived about a mile from highbury , was a frequent visitor , and always welcome , and at this time more welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london . he had returned to a late dinner , after some days \\' absence , and now walked up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square . it was a happy circumstance , and animated mr . woodhouse for some time . mr . knightley had a cheerful manner , which always did him good ; and his many inquiries after \" poor isabella \" and her children were answered most satisfactorily . when this was over , mr . woodhouse gratefully observed , \" it is very kind of you , mr . knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us . i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk .\" \" not at all , sir . it is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire .\" \" but you must have found it very damp and dirty . i wish you may not catch cold .\" \" dirty , sir ! look at my shoes . not a speck on them .\" \" well ! that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here . it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast . i wanted them to put off the wedding .\" \" by the bye -- i have not wished you joy . being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , i have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but i hope it all went off tolerably well . how did you all behave ? who cried most ?\" \" ah ! poor miss taylor ! \\' tis a sad business .\" \" poor mr . and miss woodhouse , if you please ; but i cannot possibly say ` poor miss taylor .\\' i have a great regard for you and emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence !-- at any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two .\" \" especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature !\" said emma playfully . \" that is what you have in your head , i know -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by .\" \" i believe it is very true , my dear , indeed ,\" said mr . woodhouse , with a sigh . \" i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome .\" \" my dearest papa ! you do not think i could mean _you_ , or suppose mr . knightley to mean _you_ . what a horrible idea ! oh no ! i meant only myself . mr . knightley loves to find fault with me , you know -- in a joke -- it is all a joke . we always say what we like to one another .\" mr . knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body . \" emma knows i never flatter her ,\" said mr . knightley , \" but i meant no reflection on any body . miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one . the chances are that she must be a gainer .\" \" well ,\" said emma , willing to let it pass --\" you want to hear about the wedding ; and i shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly . every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen . oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day .\" \" dear emma bears every thing so well ,\" said her father . \" but , mr . knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor , and i am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for .\" emma turned away her head , divided between tears and smiles . \" it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion ,\" said mr . knightley . \" we should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor \\' s advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at miss taylor \\' s time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure . every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married .\" \" and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me ,\" said emma , \" and a very considerable one -- that i made the match myself . i made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said mr . weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing .\" mr . knightley shook his head at her . her father fondly replied , \" ah ! my dear , i wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass . pray do not make any more matches .\" \" i promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but i must , indeed , for other people . it is the greatest amusement in the world ! and after such success , you know !-- every body said that mr . weston would never marry again . oh dear , no ! mr . weston , who had been a widower so long , and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife , so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here , always acceptable wherever he went , always cheerful -- mr . weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it . oh no ! mr . weston certainly would never marry again . some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him . all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but i believed none of it . \" ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchell \\' s , i made up my mind on the subject . i planned the match from that hour ; and when such success has blessed me in this instance , dear papa , you cannot think that i shall leave off match - making .\" \" i do not understand what you mean by ` success ,\\'\" said mr . knightley . \" success supposes endeavour . your time has been properly and delicately spent , if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage . a worthy employment for a young lady \\' s mind ! but if , which i rather imagine , your making the match , as you call it , means only your planning it , your saying to yourself one idle day , ` i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr . weston were to marry her ,\\' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards , why do you talk of success ? where is your merit ? what are you proud of ? you made a lucky guess ; and _that_ is all that can be said .\" \" and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ?-- i pity you .-- i thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck . there is always some talent in it . and as to my poor word ` success ,\\' which you quarrel with , i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it . you have drawn two pretty pictures ; but i think there may be a third -- a something between the do - nothing and the do - all . if i had not promoted mr . weston \\' s visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all . i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that .\" \" a straightforward , open - hearted man like weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like miss taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns . you are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference .\" \" emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others ,\" rejoined mr . woodhouse , understanding but in part . \" but , my dear , pray do not make any more matches ; they are silly things , and break up one \\' s family circle grievously .\" \" only one more , papa ; only for mr . elton . poor mr . elton ! you like mr . elton , papa ,-- i must look about for a wife for him . there is nobody in highbury who deserves him -- and he has been here a whole year , and has fitted up his house so comfortably , that it would be a shame to have him single any longer -- and i thought when he was joining their hands to - day , he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him ! i think very well of mr . elton , and this is the only way i have of doing him a service .\" \" mr . elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and i have a great regard for him . but if you want to shew him any attention , my dear , ask him to come and dine with us some day . that will be a much better thing . i dare say mr . knightley will be so kind as to meet him .\" \" with a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time ,\" said mr . knightley , laughing , \" and i agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing . invite him to dinner , emma , and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken , but leave him to chuse his own wife . depend upon it , a man of six or seven - and - twenty can take care of himself .\" chapter ii mr . weston was a native of highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property . he had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied . captain weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill , of a great yorkshire family , and miss churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend . miss churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of mr . and mrs . churchill , who threw her off with due decorum . it was an unsuitable connexion , and did not produce much happiness . mrs . weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best . she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother \\' s unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home . they lived beyond their income , but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe : she did not cease to love her husband , but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston , and miss churchill of enscombe . captain weston , who had been considered , especially by the churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years \\' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain . from the expense of the child , however , he was soon relieved . the boy had , with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother \\' s , been the means of a sort of reconciliation ; and mr . and mrs . churchill , having no children of their own , nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for , offered to take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease . some scruples and some reluctance the widower - father may be supposed to have felt ; but as they were overcome by other considerations , the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills , and he had only his own comfort to seek , and his own situation to improve as he could . a complete change of life became desirable . he quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in london , which afforded him a favourable opening . it was a concern which brought just employment enough . he had still a small house in highbury , where most of his leisure days were spent ; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society , the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away . he had , by that time , realised an easy competence -- enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury , which he had always longed for -- enough to marry a woman as portionless even as miss taylor , and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition . it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase randalls , and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished . he had made his fortune , bought his house , and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence , with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through . he had never been an unhappy man ; his own temper had secured him from that , even in his first marriage ; but his second must shew him how delightful a well - judging and truly amiable woman could be , and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen , to excite gratitude than to feel it . he had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle \\' s heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age . it was most unlikely , therefore , that he should ever want his father \\' s assistance . his father had no apprehension of it . the aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in mr . weston \\' s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear . he saw his son every year in london , and was proud of him ; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too . he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern . mr . frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life . his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved . now , upon his father \\' s marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place . there was not a dissentient voice on the subject , either when mrs . perry drank tea with mrs . and miss bates , or when mrs . and miss bates returned the visit . now was the time for mr . frank churchill to come among them ; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion . for a few days , every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs . weston had received . \" i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr . frank churchill has written to mrs . weston ? i understand it was a very handsome letter , indeed . mr . woodhouse told me of it . mr . woodhouse saw the letter , and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life .\" it was , indeed , a highly prized letter . mrs . weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . she felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her . she knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of emma \\' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour \\' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations . and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in mr . weston \\' s disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to mrs . weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor miss taylor ,\\' when they left her at randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own . but never did she go without mr . woodhouse \\' s giving a gentle sigh , and saying , \" ah , poor miss taylor ! she would be very glad to stay .\" there was no recovering miss taylor -- nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to mr . woodhouse . the compliments of his neighbours were over ; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event ; and the wedding - cake , which had been a great distress to him , was all eat up . his own stomach could bear nothing rich , and he could never believe other people to be different from himself . what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had , therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding - cake at all , and when that proved vain , as earnestly tried to prevent any body \\' s eating it . he had been at the pains of consulting mr . perry , the apothecary , on the subject . mr . perry was an intelligent , gentlemanlike man , whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of mr . woodhouse \\' s life ; and upon being applied to , he could not but acknowledge ( though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination ) that wedding - cake might certainly disagree with many -- perhaps with most people , unless taken moderately . with such an opinion , in confirmation of his own , mr . woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair ; but still the cake was eaten ; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone . there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being seen with a slice of mrs . weston \\' s wedding - cake in their hands : but mr . woodhouse would never believe it . chapter iii mr . woodhouse was fond of society in his own way . he liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked . he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms . fortunately for him , highbury , including randalls in the same parish , and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of mr . knightley , comprehended many such . not unfrequently , through emma \\' s persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card - table for him . real , long - standing regard brought the westons and mr . knightley ; and by mr . elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr . woodhouse \\' s drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away . after these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were mrs . and miss bates , and mrs . goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that mr . woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses . had it taken place only once a year , it would have been a grievance . mrs . bates , the widow of a former vicar of highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille . she lived with her single daughter in a very small way , and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady , under such untoward circumstances , can excite . her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married . miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect . she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness . her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible . and yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will . it was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders . she loved every body , was interested in every body \\' s happiness , quicksighted to every body \\' s merits ; thought herself a most fortunate creature , and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother , and so many good neighbours and friends , and a home that wanted for nothing . the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature , her contented and grateful spirit , were a recommendation to every body , and a mine of felicity to herself . she was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited mr . woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip . mrs . goddard was the mistress of a school -- not of a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new systems -- and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity -- but a real , honest , old - fashioned boarding - school , where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent to be out of the way , and scramble themselves into a little education , without any danger of coming back prodigies . mrs . goddard \\' s school was in high repute -- and very deservedly ; for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot : she had an ample house and garden , gave the children plenty of wholesome food , let them run about a great deal in the summer , and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands . it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church . she was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to mr . woodhouse \\' s kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside . these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father \\' s sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of mrs . weston . she was delighted to see her father look comfortable , and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well ; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated . as she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from mrs . goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring miss smith with her ; a most welcome request : for miss smith was a girl of seventeen , whom emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty . a very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion . harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody . somebody had placed her , several years back , at mrs . goddard \\' s school , and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour - boarder . this was all that was generally known of her history . she had no visible friends but what had been acquired at highbury , and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her . she was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which emma particularly admired . she was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance . she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smith \\' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement . encouragement should be given . those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions . the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her . the friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm . they were a family of the name of martin , whom emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of mr . knightley , and residing in the parish of donwell -- very creditably , she believed -- she knew mr . knightley thought highly of them -- but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect . _she_ would notice her ; she would improve her ; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions and her manners . it would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers . she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware . with an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively , with the real good - will of a mind delighted with its own ideas , did she then do all the honours of the meal , and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters , with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests . upon such occasions poor mr . woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare . he loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat . such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say : \" mrs . bates , let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs . an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome . serle understands boiling an egg better than any body . i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else ; but you need not be afraid , they are very small , you see -- one of our small eggs will not hurt you . miss bates , let emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart -- a _very_ little bit . ours are all apple - tarts . you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here . i do not advise the custard . mrs . goddard , what say you to _half_ a glass of wine ? a _small_ half - glass , put into a tumbler of water ? i do not think it could disagree with you .\" emma allowed her father to talk -- but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy . the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions . miss woodhouse was so great a personage in highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last ! chapter iv harriet smith \\' s intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing . quick and decided in her ways , emma lost no time in inviting , encouraging , and telling her to come very often ; and as their acquaintance increased , so did their satisfaction in each other . as a walking companion , emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her . in that respect mrs . weston \\' s loss had been important . her father never went beyond the shrubbery , where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk , or his short , as the year varied ; and since mrs . weston \\' s marriage her exercise had been too much confined . she had ventured once alone to randalls , but it was not pleasant ; and a harriet smith , therefore , one whom she could summon at any time to a walk , would be a valuable addition to her privileges . but in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs . harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to . her early attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no want of taste , though strength of understanding must not be expected . altogether she was quite convinced of harriet smith \\' s being exactly the young friend she wanted -- exactly the something which her home required . such a friend as mrs . weston was out of the question . two such could never be granted . two such she did not want . it was quite a different sort of thing , a sentiment distinct and independent . mrs . weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem . harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful . for mrs . weston there was nothing to be done ; for harriet every thing . her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but harriet could not tell . she was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain . emma was obliged to fancy what she liked -- but she could never believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth . harriet had no penetration . she had been satisfied to hear and believe just what mrs . goddard chose to tell her ; and looked no farther . mrs . goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation -- and but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbey - mill farm , it must have been the whole . but the martins occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent two very happy months with them , and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place . emma encouraged her talkativeness -- amused by such a picture of another set of beings , and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of mrs . martin \\' s having \" _two_ parlours , two very good parlours , indeed ; one of them quite as large as mrs . goddard \\' s drawing - room ; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five - and - twenty years with her ; and of their having eight cows , two of them alderneys , and one a little welch cow , a very pretty little welch cow indeed ; and of mrs . martin \\' s saying as she was so fond of it , it should be called _her_ cow ; and of their having a very handsome summer - house in their garden , where some day next year they were all to drink tea :-- a very handsome summer - house , large enough to hold a dozen people .\" for some time she was amused , without thinking beyond the immediate cause ; but as she came to understand the family better , other feelings arose . she had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son \\' s wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the mr . martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young mrs . martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever . with this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr . martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it . harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games ; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good - humoured and obliging . he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts , because she had said how fond she was of them , and in every thing else he was so very obliging . he had his shepherd \\' s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her . she was very fond of singing . he could sing a little himself . she believed he was very clever , and understood every thing . he had a very fine flock , and , while she was with them , he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country . she believed every body spoke well of him . his mother and sisters were very fond of him . mrs . martin had told her one day ( and there was a blush as she said it ,) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son , and therefore she was sure , whenever he married , he would make a good husband . not that she _wanted_ him to marry . she was in no hurry at all . \" well done , mrs . martin !\" thought emma . \" you know what you are about .\" \" and when she had come away , mrs . martin was so very kind as to send mrs . goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose mrs . goddard had ever seen . mrs . goddard had dressed it on a sunday , and asked all the three teachers , miss nash , and miss prince , and miss richardson , to sup with her .\" \" mr . martin , i suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ? he does not read ?\" \" oh yes !-- that is , no -- i do not know -- but i believe he has read a good deal -- but not what you would think any thing of . he reads the agricultural reports , and some other books that lay in one of the window seats -- but he reads all _them_ to himself . but sometimes of an evening , before we went to cards , he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts , very entertaining . and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield . he never read the romance of the forest , nor the children of the abbey . he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them , but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can .\" the next question was -- \" what sort of looking man is mr . martin ?\" \" oh ! not handsome -- not at all handsome . i thought him very plain at first , but i do not think him so plain now . one does not , you know , after a time . but did you never see him ? he is in highbury every now and then , and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston . he has passed you very often .\" \" that may be , and i may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name . a young farmer , whether on horseback or on foot , is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity . the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do . a degree or two lower , and a creditable appearance might interest me ; i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other . but a farmer can need none of my help , and is , therefore , in one sense , as much above my notice as in every other he is below it .\" \" to be sure . oh yes ! it is not likely you should ever have observed him ; but he knows you very well indeed -- i mean by sight .\" \" i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man . i know , indeed , that he is so , and , as such , wish him well . what do you imagine his age to be ?\" \" he was four - and - twenty the 8th of last june , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day \\' s difference -- which is very odd .\" \" only four - and - twenty . that is too young to settle . his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry . they seem very comfortable as they are , and if she were to take any pains to marry him , she would probably repent it . six years hence , if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own , with a little money , it might be very desirable .\" \" six years hence ! dear miss woodhouse , he would be thirty years old !\" \" well , and that is as early as most men can afford to marry , who are not born to an independence . mr . martin , i imagine , has his fortune entirely to make -- cannot be at all beforehand with the world . whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , i dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet .\" \" to be sure , so it is . but they live very comfortably . they have no indoors man , else they do not want for any thing ; and mrs . martin talks of taking a boy another year .\" \" i wish you may not get into a scrape , harriet , whenever he does marry ;-- i mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice . the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates . there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman \\' s daughter , and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power , or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you .\" \" yes , to be sure , i suppose there are . but while i visit at hartfield , and you are so kind to me , miss woodhouse , i am not afraid of what any body can do .\" \" you understand the force of influence pretty well , harriet ; but i would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse . i want to see you permanently well connected , and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be ; and , therefore , i say that if you should still be in this country when mr . martin marries , i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters , to be acquainted with the wife , who will probably be some mere farmer \\' s daughter , without education .\" \" to be sure . yes . not that i think mr . martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up . however , i do not mean to set up my opinion against your \\' s -- and i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife . i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins , especially elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me . but if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , certainly i had better not visit her , if i can help it .\" emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love . the young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on harriet \\' s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own . they met mr . martin the very next day , as they were walking on the donwell road . he was on foot , and after looking very respectfully at her , looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion . emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few yards forward , while they talked together , soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr . robert martin . his appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in harriet \\' s inclination . harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father \\' s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder . mr . martin looked as if he did not know what manner was . they remained but a few minutes together , as miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose . \" only think of our happening to meet him !-- how very odd ! it was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by randalls . he did not think we ever walked this road . he thought we walked towards randalls most days . he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet . he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to - morrow . so very odd we should happen to meet ! well , miss woodhouse , is he like what you expected ? what do you think of him ? do you think him so very plain ?\" \" he is very plain , undoubtedly -- remarkably plain :-- but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility . i had no right to expect much , and i did not expect much ; but i had no idea that he could be so very clownish , so totally without air . i had imagined him , i confess , a degree or two nearer gentility .\" \" to be sure ,\" said harriet , in a mortified voice , \" he is not so genteel as real gentlemen .\" \" i think , harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr . martin . at hartfield , you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men . i should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with mr . martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before . do not you begin to feel that now ? were not you struck ? i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated as i stood here .\" \" certainly , he is not like mr . knightley . he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr . knightley . i see the difference plain enough . but mr . knightley is so very fine a man !\" \" mr . knightley \\' s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr . martin with _him_ . you might not see one in a hundred with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in mr . knightley . but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to . what say you to mr . weston and mr . elton ? compare mr . martin with either of _them_ . compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent . you must see the difference .\" \" oh yes !-- there is a great difference . but mr . weston is almost an old man . mr . weston must be between forty and fifty .\" \" which makes his good manners the more valuable . the older a person grows , harriet , the more important it is that their manners should not be bad ; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness , or coarseness , or awkwardness becomes . what is passable in youth is detestable in later age . mr . martin is now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at mr . weston \\' s time of life ?\" \" there is no saying , indeed ,\" replied harriet rather solemnly . \" but there may be pretty good guessing . he will be a completely gross , vulgar farmer , totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing but profit and loss .\" \" will he , indeed ? that will be very bad .\" \" how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended . he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else -- which is just as it should be , for a thriving man . what has he to do with books ? and i have no doubt that he _will_ thrive , and be a very rich man in time -- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _us_ .\" \" i wonder he did not remember the book \"-- was all harriet \\' s answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might be safely left to itself . she , therefore , said no more for some time . her next beginning was , \" in one respect , perhaps , mr . elton \\' s manners are superior to mr . knightley \\' s or mr . weston \\' s . they have more gentleness . they might be more safely held up as a pattern . there is an openness , a quickness , almost a bluntness in mr . weston , which every body likes in _him_ , because there is so much good - humour with it -- but that would not do to be copied . neither would mr . knightley \\' s downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _him_ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable . on the contrary , i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr . elton as a model . mr . elton is good - humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle . he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late . i do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us , harriet , by additional softness , but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be . if he means any thing , it must be to please you . did not i tell you what he said of you the other day ?\" she then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from mr . elton , and now did full justice to ; and harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought mr . elton very agreeable . mr . elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young farmer out of harriet \\' s head . she thought it would be an excellent match ; and only too palpably desirable , natural , and probable , for her to have much merit in planning it . she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict . it was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of harriet \\' s coming to hartfield . the longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency . mr . elton \\' s situation was most suitable , quite the gentleman himself , and without low connexions ; at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet . he had a comfortable home for her , and emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good - humoured , well - meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world . she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on harriet \\' s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy . and he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like . he was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with :-- but the girl who could be gratified by a robert martin \\' s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by mr . elton \\' s admiration . chapter v \" i do not know what your opinion may be , mrs . weston ,\" said mr . knightley , \" of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith , but i think it a bad thing .\" \" a bad thing ! do you really think it a bad thing ?-- why so ?\" \" i think they will neither of them do the other any good .\" \" you surprize me ! emma must do harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , harriet may be said to do emma good . i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure . how very differently we feel !-- not think they will do each other any good ! this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about emma , mr . knightley .\" \" perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle .\" \" mr . weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject . we were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma , that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with . mr . knightley , i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case . you are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life . i can imagine your objection to harriet smith . she is not the superior young woman which emma \\' s friend ought to be . but on the other hand , as emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself . they will read together . she means it , i know .\" \" emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old . i have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule . the list she drew up when only fourteen -- i remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that i preserved it some time ; and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now . but i have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma . she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding . where miss taylor failed to stimulate , i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do nothing .-- you never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished .-- you know you could not .\" \" i dare say ,\" replied mrs . weston , smiling , \" that i thought so _then_ ;-- but since we have parted , i can never remember emma \\' s omitting to do any thing i wished .\" \" there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_ ,\"-- said mr . knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done . \" but i ,\" he soon added , \" who have had no such charm thrown over my senses , must still see , hear , and remember . emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family . at ten years old , she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen . she was always quick and assured : isabella slow and diffident . and ever since she was twelve , emma has been mistress of the house and of you all . in her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her . she inherits her mother \\' s talents , and must have been under subjection to her .\" \" i should have been sorry , mr . knightley , to be dependent on _your_ recommendation , had i quitted mr . woodhouse \\' s family and wanted another situation ; i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body . i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held .\" \" yes ,\" said he , smiling . \" you are better placed _here_ ; very fit for a wife , but not at all for a governess . but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield . you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise ; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_ , on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will , and doing as you were bid ; and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife , i should certainly have named miss taylor .\" \" thank you . there will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as mr . weston .\" \" why , to own the truth , i am afraid you are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition to bear , there will be nothing to be borne . we will not despair , however . weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort , or his son may plague him .\" \" i hope not _that_ .-- it is not likely . no , mr . knightley , do not foretell vexation from that quarter .\" \" not i , indeed . i only name possibilities . i do not pretend to emma \\' s genius for foretelling and guessing . i hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a weston in merit , and a churchill in fortune .-- but harriet smith -- i have not half done about harriet smith . i think her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have . she knows nothing herself , and looks upon emma as knowing every thing . she is a flatterer in all her ways ; and so much the worse , because undesigned . her ignorance is hourly flattery . how can emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself , while harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority ? and as for harriet , i will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance . hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to . she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home . i am much mistaken if emma \\' s doctrines give any strength of mind , or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life .-- they only give a little polish .\" \" i either depend more upon emma \\' s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for i cannot lament the acquaintance . how well she looked last night !\" \" oh ! you would rather talk of her person than her mind , would you ? very well ; i shall not attempt to deny emma \\' s being pretty .\" \" pretty ! say beautiful rather . can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than emma altogether -- face and figure ?\" \" i do not know what i could imagine , but i confess that i have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . but i am a partial old friend .\" \" such an eye !-- the true hazle eye -- and so brilliant ! regular features , open countenance , with a complexion ! oh ! what a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! there is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . one hears sometimes of a child being ` the picture of health ;\\' now , emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown - up health . she is loveliness itself . mr . knightley , is not she ?\" \" i have not a fault to find with her person ,\" he replied . \" i think her all you describe . i love to look at her ; and i will add this praise , that i do not think her personally vain . considering how very handsome she is , she appears to be little occupied with it ; her vanity lies another way . mrs . weston , i am not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith , or my dread of its doing them both harm .\" \" and i , mr . knightley , am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm . with all dear emma \\' s little faults , she is an excellent creature . where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ? no , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times .\" \" very well ; i will not plague you any more . emma shall be an angel , and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john and isabella . john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children . i am sure of having their opinions with me .\" \" i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , mr . knightley , if i take the liberty ( i consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma \\' s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that i do not think any possible good can arise from harriet smith \\' s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you . pray excuse me ; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy , it cannot be expected that emma , accountable to nobody but her father , who perfectly approves the acquaintance , should put an end to it , so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself . it has been so many years my province to give advice , that you cannot be surprized , mr . knightley , at this little remains of office .\" \" not at all ,\" cried he ; \" i am much obliged to you for it . it is very good advice , and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found ; for it shall be attended to .\" \" mrs . john knightley is easily alarmed , and might be made unhappy about her sister .\" \" be satisfied ,\" said he , \" i will not raise any outcry . i will keep my ill - humour to myself . i have a very sincere interest in emma . isabella does not seem more my sister ; has never excited a greater interest ; perhaps hardly so great . there is an anxiety , a curiosity in what one feels for emma . i wonder what will become of her !\" \" so do i ,\" said mrs . weston gently , \" very much .\" \" she always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all . but i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for . it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object . i should like to see emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good . but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home .\" \" there does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present ,\" said mrs . weston , \" as can well be ; and while she is so happy at hartfield , i cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor mr . woodhouse \\' s account . i do not recommend matrimony at present to emma , though i mean no slight to the state , i assure you .\" part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and mr . weston \\' s on the subject , as much as possible . there were wishes at randalls respecting emma \\' s destiny , but it was not desirable to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which mr . knightley soon afterwards made to \" what does weston think of the weather ; shall we have rain ?\" convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield . chapter vi emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriet \\' s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of mr . elton \\' s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on harriet \\' s side , as there could be any occasion for . she was quite convinced of mr . elton \\' s being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already . she had no scruple with regard to him . he talked of harriet , and praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add . his perception of the striking improvement of harriet \\' s manner , since her introduction at hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment . \" you have given miss smith all that she required ,\" said he ; \" you have made her graceful and easy . she was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature .\" \" i am glad you think i have been useful to her ; but harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints . she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself . i have done very little .\" \" if it were admissible to contradict a lady ,\" said the gallant mr . elton -- \" i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before .\" \" exactly so ; that is what principally strikes me . so much superadded decision of character ! skilful has been the hand !\" \" great has been the pleasure , i am sure . i never met with a disposition more truly amiable .\" \" i have no doubt of it .\" and it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation , which had a vast deal of the lover . she was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have harriet \\' s picture . \" did you ever have your likeness taken , harriet ?\" said she : \" did you ever sit for your picture ?\" harriet was on the point of leaving the room , and only stopt to say , with a very interesting naivete , \" oh ! dear , no , never .\" no sooner was she out of sight , than emma exclaimed , \" what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be ! i would give any money for it . i almost long to attempt her likeness myself . you do not know it i dare say , but two or three years ago i had a great passion for taking likenesses , and attempted several of my friends , and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general . but from one cause or another , i gave it up in disgust . but really , i could almost venture , if harriet would sit to me . it would be such a delight to have her picture !\" \" let me entreat you ,\" cried mr . elton ; \" it would indeed be a delight ! let me entreat you , miss woodhouse , to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend . i know what your drawings are . how could you suppose me ignorant ? is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not mrs . weston some inimitable figure - pieces in her drawing - room , at randalls ?\" yes , good man !-- thought emma -- but what has all that to do with taking likenesses ? you know nothing of drawing . don \\' t pretend to be in raptures about mine . keep your raptures for harriet \\' s face . \" well , if you give me such kind encouragement , mr . elton , i believe i shall try what i can do . harriet \\' s features are very delicate , which makes a likeness difficult ; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch .\" \" exactly so -- the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth -- i have not a doubt of your success . pray , pray attempt it . as you will do it , it will indeed , to use your own words , be an exquisite possession .\" \" but i am afraid , mr . elton , harriet will not like to sit . she thinks so little of her own beauty . did not you observe her manner of answering me ? how completely it meant , ` why should my picture be drawn ?\\'\" \" oh ! yes , i observed it , i assure you . it was not lost on me . but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded .\" harriet was soon back again , and the proposal almost immediately made ; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others . emma wished to go to work directly , and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits , for not one of them had ever been finished , that they might decide together on the best size for harriet . her many beginnings were displayed . miniatures , half - lengths , whole - lengths , pencil , crayon , and water - colours had been all tried in turn . she had always wanted to do every thing , and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to . she played and sang ;-- and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command , and ought not to have failed of . she was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician , but she was not unwilling to have others deceived , or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved . there was merit in every drawing -- in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same . they were both in ecstasies . a likeness pleases every body ; and miss woodhouse \\' s performances must be capital . \" no great variety of faces for you ,\" said emma . \" i had only my own family to study from . there is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous , that i could only take him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore . mrs . weston again , and again , and again , you see . dear mrs . weston ! always my kindest friend on every occasion . she would sit whenever i asked her . there is my sister ; and really quite her own little elegant figure !-- and the face not unlike . i should have made a good likeness of her , if she would have sat longer , but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet . then , here come all my attempts at three of those four children ;-- there they are , henry and john and bella , from one end of the sheet to the other , and any one of them might do for any one of the rest . she was so eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama \\' s children ever were . here is my sketch of the fourth , who was a baby . i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa , and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see . he had nestled down his head most conveniently . that \\' s very like . i am rather proud of little george . the corner of the sofa is very good . then here is my last ,\"-- unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size , whole - length --\" my last and my best -- my brother , mr . john knightley .-- this did not want much of being finished , when i put it away in a pet , and vowed i would never take another likeness . i could not help being provoked ; for after all my pains , and when i had really made a very good likeness of it --( mrs . weston and i were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like )-- only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that was a fault on the right side -- after all this , came poor dear isabella \\' s cold approbation of --\" yes , it was a little like -- but to be sure it did not do him justice .\" we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all . it was made a great favour of ; and altogether it was more than i could bear ; and so i never would finish it , to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness , to every morning visitor in brunswick square ;-- and , as i said , i did then forswear ever drawing any body again . but for harriet \\' s sake , or rather for my own , and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_ , i will break my resolution now .\" mr . elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea , and was repeating , \" no husbands and wives in the case at present indeed , as you observe . exactly so . no husbands and wives ,\" with so interesting a consciousness , that emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once . but as she wanted to be drawing , the declaration must wait a little longer . she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait . it was to be a whole - length in water - colours , like mr . john knightley \\' s , and was destined , if she could please herself , to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece . the sitting began ; and harriet , smiling and blushing , and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance , presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist . but there was no doing any thing , with mr . elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch . she gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence ; but was really obliged to put an end to it , and request him to place himself elsewhere . it then occurred to her to employ him in reading . \" if he would be so good as to read to them , it would be a kindness indeed ! it would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of miss smith \\' s .\" mr . elton was only too happy . harriet listened , and emma drew in peace . she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed .-- there was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible . she could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable . the sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day \\' s sketch to wish to go on . there was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both -- a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as mr . elton \\' s very promising attachment was likely to add . harriet was to sit again the next day ; and mr . elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again . \" by all means . we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party .\" the same civilities and courtesies , the same success and satisfaction , took place on the morrow , and accompanied the whole progress of the picture , which was rapid and happy . every body who saw it was pleased , but mr . elton was in continual raptures , and defended it through every criticism . \" miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted ,\"-- observed mrs . weston to him -- not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover .--\" the expression of the eye is most correct , but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes . it is the fault of her face that she has them not .\" \" do you think so ?\" replied he . \" i cannot agree with you . it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature . i never saw such a likeness in my life . we must allow for the effect of shade , you know .\" \" you have made her too tall , emma ,\" said mr . knightley . emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and mr . elton warmly added , \" oh no ! certainly not too tall ; not in the least too tall . consider , she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved , you know . proportions , fore - shortening .-- oh no ! it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith \\' s . exactly so indeed !\" \" it is very pretty ,\" said mr . woodhouse . \" so prettily done ! just as your drawings always are , my dear . i do not know any body who draws so well as you do . the only thing i do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold .\" \" but , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer . look at the tree .\" \" but it is never safe to sit out of doors , my dear .\" \" you , sir , may say any thing ,\" cried mr . elton , \" but i must confess that i regard it as a most happy thought , the placing of miss smith out of doors ; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit ! any other situation would have been much less in character . the naivete of miss smith \\' s manners -- and altogether -- oh , it is most admirable ! i cannot keep my eyes from it . i never saw such a likeness .\" the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties . it must be done directly ; it must be done in london ; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on ; and isabella , the usual doer of all commissions , must not be applied to , because it was december , and mr . woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of december . but no sooner was the distress known to mr . elton , than it was removed . his gallantry was always on the alert . \" might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it ! he could ride to london at any time . it was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand .\" \" he was too good !-- she could not endure the thought !-- she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world ,\"-- brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances ,-- and a very few minutes settled the business . mr . elton was to take the drawing to london , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough . \" what a precious deposit !\" said he with a tender sigh , as he received it . \" this man is almost too gallant to be in love ,\" thought emma . \" i should say so , but that i suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love . he is an excellent young man , and will suit harriet exactly ; it will be an ` exactly so ,\\' as he says himself ; but he does sigh and languish , and study for compliments rather more than i could endure as a principal . i come in for a pretty good share as a second . but it is his gratitude on harriet \\' s account .\" chapter vii the very day of mr . elton \\' s going to london produced a fresh occasion for emma \\' s services towards her friend . harriet had been at hartfield , as usual , soon after breakfast ; and , after a time , had gone home to return again to dinner : she returned , and sooner than had been talked of , and with an agitated , hurried look , announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell . half a minute brought it all out . she had heard , as soon as she got back to mrs . goddard \\' s , that mr . martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from mr . martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage . \" who could have thought it ? she was so surprized she did not know what to do . yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so . and he wrote as if he really loved her very much -- but she did not know -- and so , she was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she should do .--\" emma was half - ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful . \" upon my word ,\" she cried , \" the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking . he will connect himself well if he can .\" \" will you read the letter ?\" cried harriet . \" pray do . i \\' d rather you would .\" emma was not sorry to be pressed . she read , and was surprized . the style of the letter was much above her expectation . there were not merely no grammatical errors , but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman ; the language , though plain , was strong and unaffected , and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer . it was short , but expressed good sense , warm attachment , liberality , propriety , even delicacy of feeling . she paused over it , while harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a \" well , well ,\" and was at last forced to add , \" is it a good letter ? or is it too short ?\" \" yes , indeed , a very good letter ,\" replied emma rather slowly --\" so good a letter , harriet , that every thing considered , i think one of his sisters must have helped him . i can hardly imagine the young man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman . no doubt he is a sensible man , and i suppose may have a natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words . it is so with some men . yes , i understand the sort of mind . vigorous , decided , with sentiments to a certain point , not coarse . a better written letter , harriet ( returning it ,) than i had expected .\" \" well ,\" said the still waiting harriet ;--\" well -- and -- and what shall i do ?\" \" what shall you do ! in what respect ? do you mean with regard to this letter ?\" \" yes .\" \" but what are you in doubt of ? you must answer it of course -- and speedily .\" \" yes . but what shall i say ? dear miss woodhouse , do advise me .\" \" oh no , no ! the letter had much better be all your own . you will express yourself very properly , i am sure . there is no danger of your not being intelligible , which is the first thing . your meaning must be unequivocal ; no doubts or demurs : and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires , will present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind , i am persuaded . you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment .\" \" you think i ought to refuse him then ,\" said harriet , looking down . \" ought to refuse him ! my dear harriet , what do you mean ? are you in any doubt as to that ? i thought -- but i beg your pardon , perhaps i have been under a mistake . i certainly have been misunderstanding you , if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer . i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it .\" harriet was silent . with a little reserve of manner , emma continued : \" you mean to return a favourable answer , i collect .\" \" no , i do not ; that is , i do not mean -- what shall i do ? what would you advise me to do ? pray , dear miss woodhouse , tell me what i ought to do .\" \" i shall not give you any advice , harriet . i will have nothing to do with it . this is a point which you must settle with your feelings .\" \" i had no notion that he liked me so very much ,\" said harriet , contemplating the letter . for a little while emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say , \" i lay it down as a general rule , harriet , that if a woman _doubts_ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him . if she can hesitate as to ` yes ,\\' she ought to say ` no \\' directly . it is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings , with half a heart . i thought it my duty as a friend , and older than yourself , to say thus much to you . but do not imagine that i want to influence you .\" \" oh ! no , i am sure you are a great deal too kind to -- but if you would just advise me what i had best do -- no , no , i do not mean that -- as you say , one \\' s mind ought to be quite made up -- one should not be hesitating -- it is a very serious thing .-- it will be safer to say ` no ,\\' perhaps .-- do you think i had better say ` no ?\\'\" \" not for the world ,\" said emma , smiling graciously , \" would i advise you either way . you must be the best judge of your own happiness . if you prefer mr . martin to every other person ; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with , why should you hesitate ? you blush , harriet .-- does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition ? harriet , harriet , do not deceive yourself ; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion . at this moment whom are you thinking of ?\" the symptoms were favourable .-- instead of answering , harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard . emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes . at last , with some hesitation , harriet said -- \" miss woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , i must do as well as i can by myself ; and i have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse mr . martin . do you think i am right ?\" \" perfectly , perfectly right , my dearest harriet ; you are doing just what you ought . while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to myself , but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation in approving . dear harriet , i give myself joy of this . it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance , which must have been the consequence of your marrying mr . martin . while you were in the smallest degree wavering , i said nothing about it , because i would not influence ; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me . i could not have visited mrs . robert martin , of abbey - mill farm . now i am secure of you for ever .\" harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly . \" you could not have visited me !\" she cried , looking aghast . \" no , to be sure you could not ; but i never thought of that before . that would have been too dreadful !-- what an escape !-- dear miss woodhouse , i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world .\" \" indeed , harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been . you would have thrown yourself out of all good society . i must have given you up .\" \" dear me !-- how should i ever have borne it ! it would have killed me never to come to hartfield any more !\" \" dear affectionate creature !-- _you_ banished to abbey - mill farm !-- _you_ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life ! i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it . he must have a pretty good opinion of himself .\" \" i do not think he is conceited either , in general ,\" said harriet , her conscience opposing such censure ; \" at least , he is very good natured , and i shall always feel much obliged to him , and have a great regard for -- but that is quite a different thing from -- and you know , though he may like me , it does not follow that i should -- and certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen people -- and if one comes to compare them , person and manners , there is no comparison at all , _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable . however , i do really think mr . martin a very amiable young man , and have a great opinion of him ; and his being so much attached to me -- and his writing such a letter -- but as to leaving you , it is what i would not do upon any consideration .\" \" thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend . we will not be parted . a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter .\" \" oh no ;-- and it is but a short letter too .\" emma felt the bad taste of her friend , but let it pass with a \" very true ; and it would be a small consolation to her , for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day , to know that her husband could write a good letter .\" \" oh ! yes , very . nobody cares for a letter ; the thing is , to be always happy with pleasant companions . i am quite determined to refuse him . but how shall i do ? what shall i say ?\" emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence . the looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all . this letter , however , was written , and sealed , and sent . the business was finished , and harriet safe . she was rather low all the evening , but emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr . elton . \" i shall never be invited to abbey - mill again ,\" was said in rather a sorrowful tone . \" nor , if you were , could i ever bear to part with you , my harriet . you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey - mill .\" \" and i am sure i should never want to go there ; for i am never happy but at hartfield .\" some time afterwards it was , \" i think mrs . goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened . i am sure miss nash would -- for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married , and it is only a linen - draper .\" \" one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school , harriet . i dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married . even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes . as to any thing superior for you , i suppose she is quite in the dark . the attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle - tattle of highbury yet . hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves .\" harriet blushed and smiled , and said something about wondering that people should like her so much . the idea of mr . elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender - hearted again towards the rejected mr . martin . \" now he has got my letter ,\" said she softly . \" i wonder what they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too . i hope he will not mind it so very much .\" \" let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed ,\" cried emma . \" at this moment , perhaps , mr . elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters , telling how much more beautiful is the original , and after being asked for it five or six times , allowing them to hear your name , your own dear name .\" \" my picture !-- but he has left my picture in bond - street .\" \" has he so !-- then i know nothing of mr . elton . no , my dear little modest harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in bond - street till just before he mounts his horse to - morrow . it is his companion all this evening , his solace , his delight . it opens his designs to his family , it introduces you among them , it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature , eager curiosity and warm prepossession . how cheerful , how animated , how suspicious , how busy their imaginations all are !\" harriet smiled again , and her smiles grew stronger . chapter viii harriet slept at hartfield that night . for some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed - room appropriated to herself ; and emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present . she was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs . goddard \\' s , but it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days . while she was gone , mr . knightley called , and sat some time with mr . woodhouse and emma , till mr . woodhouse , who had previously made up his mind to walk out , was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it , and was induced by the entreaties of both , though against the scruples of his own civility , to leave mr . knightley for that purpose . mr . knightley , who had nothing of ceremony about him , was offering by his short , decided answers , an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other . \" well , i believe , if you will excuse me , mr . knightley , if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing , i shall take emma \\' s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour . as the sun is out , i believe i had better take my three turns while i can . i treat you without ceremony , mr . knightley . we invalids think we are privileged people .\" \" my dear sir , do not make a stranger of me .\" \" i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter . emma will be happy to entertain you . and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk .\" \" you cannot do better , sir .\" \" i would ask for the pleasure of your company , mr . knightley , but i am a very slow walker , and my pace would be tedious to you ; and , besides , you have another long walk before you , to donwell abbey .\" \" thank you , sir , thank you ; i am going this moment myself ; and i think the sooner _you_ go the better . i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you .\" mr . woodhouse at last was off ; but mr . knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat . he began speaking of harriet , and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before . \" i cannot rate her beauty as you do ,\" said he ; \" but she is a pretty little creature , and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition . her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman .\" \" i am glad you think so ; and the good hands , i hope , may not be wanting .\" \" come ,\" said he , \" you are anxious for a compliment , so i will tell you that you have improved her . you have cured her of her school - girl \\' s giggle ; she really does you credit .\" \" thank you . i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i had been of some use ; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may . _you_ do not often overpower me with it .\" \" you are expecting her again , you say , this morning ?\" \" almost every moment . she has been gone longer already than she intended .\" \" something has happened to delay her ; some visitors perhaps .\" \" highbury gossips !-- tiresome wretches !\" \" harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would .\" emma knew this was too true for contradiction , and therefore said nothing . he presently added , with a smile , \" i do not pretend to fix on times or places , but i must tell you that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage .\" \" indeed ! how so ? of what sort ?\" \" a very serious sort , i assure you ;\" still smiling . \" very serious ! i can think of but one thing -- who is in love with her ? who makes you their confidant ?\" emma was more than half in hopes of mr . elton \\' s having dropt a hint . mr . knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew mr . elton looked up to him . \" i have reason to think ,\" he replied , \" that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage , and from a most unexceptionable quarter :-- robert martin is the man . her visit to abbey - mill , this summer , seems to have done his business . he is desperately in love and means to marry her .\" \" he is very obliging ,\" said emma ; \" but is he sure that harriet means to marry him ?\" \" well , well , means to make her an offer then . will that do ? he came to the abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it . he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family , and , i believe , considers me as one of his best friends . he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early ; whether i thought her too young : in short , whether i approved his choice altogether ; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered ( especially since _your_ making so much of her ) as in a line of society above him . i was very much pleased with all that he said . i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin . he always speaks to the purpose ; open , straightforward , and very well judging . he told me every thing ; his circumstances and plans , and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage . he is an excellent young man , both as son and brother . i had no hesitation in advising him to marry . he proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , i was convinced he could not do better . i praised the fair lady too , and altogether sent him away very happy . if he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , i dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had . this happened the night before last . now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs . goddard \\' s to - day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch .\" \" pray , mr . knightley ,\" said emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , \" how do you know that mr . martin did not speak yesterday ?\" \" certainly ,\" replied he , surprized , \" i do not absolutely know it ; but it may be inferred . was not she the whole day with you ?\" \" come ,\" said she , \" i will tell you something , in return for what you have told me . he did speak yesterday -- that is , he wrote , and was refused .\" this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed ; and mr . knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall indignation , and said , \" then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her . what is the foolish girl about ?\" \" oh ! to be sure ,\" cried emma , \" it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage . a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her .\" \" nonsense ! a man does not imagine any such thing . but what is the meaning of this ? harriet smith refuse robert martin ? madness , if it is so ; but i hope you are mistaken .\" \" i saw her answer !-- nothing could be clearer .\" \" you saw her answer !-- you wrote her answer too . emma , this is your doing . you persuaded her to refuse him .\" \" and if i did , ( which , however , i am far from allowing ) i should not feel that i had done wrong . mr . martin is a very respectable young man , but i cannot admit him to be harriet \\' s equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her . by your account , he does seem to have had some scruples . it is a pity that they were ever got over .\" \" not harriet \\' s equal !\" exclaimed mr . knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , \" no , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation . emma , your infatuation about that girl blinds you . what are harriet smith \\' s claims , either of birth , nature or education , to any connexion higher than robert martin ? she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom , with probably no settled provision at all , and certainly no respectable relations . she is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school . she is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of any information . she has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself . at her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her . she is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all . my only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him . i felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse . but i could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well . the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt ( nor have i now ) that there would be a general cry - out upon her extreme good luck . even _your_ satisfaction i made sure of . it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend \\' s leaving highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well . i remember saying to myself , ` even emma , with all her partiality for harriet , will think this a good match .\\'\" \" i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing . what ! think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit mr . martin is nothing more ,) a good match for my intimate friend ! not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own ! i wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings . i assure you mine are very different . i must think your statement by no means fair . you are not just to harriet \\' s claims . they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself ; mr . martin may be the richest of the two , but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society .-- the sphere in which she moves is much above his .-- it would be a degradation .\" \" a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance , to be married to a respectable , intelligent gentleman - farmer !\" \" as to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called nobody , it will not hold in common sense . she is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up .-- there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune .-- her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort .-- that she is a gentleman \\' s daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen \\' s daughters , no one , i apprehend , will deny .-- she is superior to mr . robert martin .\" \" whoever might be her parents ,\" said mr . knightley , \" whoever may have had the charge of her , it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society . after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs . goddard \\' s hands to shift as she can ;-- to move , in short , in mrs . goddard \\' s line , to have mrs . goddard \\' s acquaintance . her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it _was_ good enough . she desired nothing better herself . till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it . she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer . she had no sense of superiority then . if she has it now , you have given it . you have been no friend to harriet smith , emma . robert martin would never have proceeded so far , if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him . i know him well . he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion . and as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man i know . depend upon it he had encouragement .\" it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion ; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again . \" you are a very warm friend to mr . martin ; but , as i said before , are unjust to harriet . harriet \\' s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them . she is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly . waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good - natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice . her good - nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people . i am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess .\" \" upon my word , emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too . better be without sense , than misapply it as you do .\" \" to be sure !\" cried she playfully . \" i know _that_ is the feeling of you all . i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment . oh ! harriet may pick and chuse . were you , yourself , ever to marry , she is the very woman for you . and is she , at seventeen , just entering into life , just beginning to be known , to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives ? no -- pray let her have time to look about her .\" \" i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy ,\" said mr . knightley presently , \" though i have kept my thoughts to myself ; but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet . you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty , and of what she has a claim to , that , in a little while , nobody within her reach will be good enough for her . vanity working on a weak head , produces every sort of mischief . nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high . miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl . men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives . men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed . let her marry robert martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour - boarder at mrs . goddard \\' s all the rest of her life -- or , at least , ( for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other ,) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing - master \\' s son .\" \" we think so very differently on this point , mr . knightley , that there can be no use in canvassing it . we shall only be making each other more angry . but as to my _letting_ her marry robert martin , it is impossible ; she has refused him , and so decidedly , i think , as must prevent any second application . she must abide by the evil of having refused him , whatever it may be ; and as to the refusal itself , i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little ; but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do . his appearance is so much against him , and his manner so bad , that if she ever were disposed to favour him , she is not now . i can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him . he was the brother of her friends , and he took pains to please her ; and altogether , having seen nobody better ( that must have been his great assistant ) she might not , while she was at abbey - mill , find him disagreeable . but the case is altered now . she knows now what gentlemen are ; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet .\" \" nonsense , errant nonsense , as ever was talked !\" cried mr . knightley .--\" robert martin \\' s manners have sense , sincerity , and good - humour to recommend them ; and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand .\" emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone . she did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable . some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence , with only one attempt on emma \\' s side to talk of the weather , but he made no answer . he was thinking . the result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words . \" robert martin has no great loss -- if he can but think so ; and i hope it will not be long before he does . your views for harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have ;-- and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man , i think it will be all labour in vain .\" emma laughed and disclaimed . he continued , \" depend upon it , elton will not do . elton is a very good sort of man , and a very respectable vicar of highbury , but not at all likely to make an imprudent match . he knows the value of a good income as well as any body . elton may talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally . he is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with harriet \\' s . he knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away . i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with , who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece .\" \" i am very much obliged to you ,\" said emma , laughing again . \" if i had set my heart on mr . elton \\' s marrying harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself . i have done with match - making indeed . i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls . i shall leave off while i am well .\" \" good morning to you ,\"-- said he , rising and walking off abruptly . he was very much vexed . he felt the disappointment of the young man , and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it , by the sanction he had given ; and the part which he was persuaded emma had taken in the affair , was provoking him exceedingly . emma remained in a state of vexation too ; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her \\' s , than in his . she did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary \\' s wrong , as mr . knightley . he walked off in more complete self - approbation than he left for her . she was not so materially cast down , however , but that a little time and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives . harriet \\' s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy . the possibility of the young man \\' s coming to mrs . goddard \\' s that morning , and meeting with harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas . the dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness ; and when harriet appeared , and in very good spirits , and without having any such reason to give for her long absence , she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind , and convinced her , that let mr . knightley think or say what he would , she had done nothing which woman \\' s friendship and woman \\' s feelings would not justify . he had frightened her a little about mr . elton ; but when she considered that mr . knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of mr . knightley \\' s pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about . he certainly might have heard mr . elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and mr . elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , mr . knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives . mr . knightley saw no such passion , and of course thought nothing of its effects ; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest ; and more than a reasonable , becoming degree of prudence , she was very sure did not belong to mr . elton . harriet \\' s cheerful look and manner established hers : she came back , not to think of mr . martin , but to talk of mr . elton . miss nash had been telling her something , which she repeated immediately with great delight . mr . perry had been to mrs . goddard \\' s to attend a sick child , and miss nash had seen him , and he had told miss nash , that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park , he had met mr . elton , and found to his great surprize , that mr . elton was actually on his road to london , and not meaning to return till the morrow , though it was the whist - club night , which he had been never known to miss before ; and mr . perry had remonstrated with him about it , and told him how shabby it was in him , their best player , to absent himself , and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day ; but it would not do ; mr . elton had been determined to go on , and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed , that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world ; and something about a very enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious . mr . perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must be a _lady_ in the case , and he told him so ; and mr . elton only looked very conscious and smiling , and rode off in great spirits . miss nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about mr . elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , \" that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom mr . elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , mr . elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness .\" chapter ix mr . knightley might quarrel with her , but emma could not quarrel with herself . he was so much displeased , that it was longer than usual before he came to hartfield again ; and when they did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven . she was sorry , but could not repent . on the contrary , her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days . the picture , elegantly framed , came safely to hand soon after mr . elton \\' s return , and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting - room , he got up to look at it , and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought ; and as for harriet \\' s feelings , they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted . emma was soon perfectly satisfied of mr . martin \\' s being no otherwise remembered , than as he furnished a contrast with mr . elton , of the utmost advantage to the latter . her views of improving her little friend \\' s mind , by a great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never yet led to more than a few first chapters , and the intention of going on to - morrow . it was much easier to chat than to study ; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at harriet \\' s fortune , than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts ; and the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present , the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life , was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with , into a thin quarto of hot - pressed paper , made up by her friend , and ornamented with ciphers and trophies . in this age of literature , such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon . miss nash , head - teacher at mrs . goddard \\' s , had written out at least three hundred ; and harriet , who had taken the first hint of it from her , hoped , with miss woodhouse \\' s help , to get a great many more . emma assisted with her invention , memory and taste ; and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand , it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order , in form as well as quantity . mr . woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls , and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in . \" so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them ! but he hoped he should in time .\" and it always ended in \" kitty , a fair but frozen maid .\" his good friend perry , too , whom he had spoken to on the subject , did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind ; but he had desired perry to be upon the watch , and as he went about so much , something , he thought , might come from that quarter . it was by no means his daughter \\' s wish that the intellects of highbury in general should be put under requisition . mr . elton was the only one whose assistance she asked . he was invited to contribute any really good enigmas , charades , or conundrums that he might recollect ; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections ; and at the same time , as she could perceive , most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant , nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips . they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles ; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled , and rather sentimentally recited , that well - known charade , my first doth affliction denote , which my second is destin \\' d to feel and my whole is the best antidote that affliction to soften and heal .-- made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already . \" why will not you write one yourself for us , mr . elton ?\" said she ; \" that is the only security for its freshness ; and nothing could be easier to you .\" \" oh no ! he had never written , hardly ever , any thing of the kind in his life . the stupidest fellow ! he was afraid not even miss woodhouse \"-- he stopt a moment --\" or miss smith could inspire him .\" the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration . he called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , emma was immediately convinced must be his own . \" i do not offer it for miss smith \\' s collection ,\" said he . \" being my friend \\' s , i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye , but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it .\" the speech was more to emma than to harriet , which emma could understand . there was deep consciousness about him , and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend \\' s . he was gone the next moment :-- after another moment \\' s pause , \" take it ,\" said emma , smiling , and pushing the paper towards harriet --\" it is for you . take your own .\" but harriet was in a tremor , and could not touch it ; and emma , never loth to be first , was obliged to examine it herself . to miss -- charade . my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , lords of the earth ! their luxury and ease . another view of man , my second brings , behold him there , the monarch of the seas ! but ah ! united , what reverse we have ! man \\' s boasted power and freedom , all are flown ; lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , and woman , lovely woman , reigns alone . thy ready wit the word will soon supply , may its approval beam in that soft eye ! she cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , \" very well , mr . elton , very well indeed . i have read worse charades . _courtship_ -- a very good hint . i give you credit for it . this is feeling your way . this is saying very plainly --` pray , miss smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you . approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance .\\' may its approval beam in that soft eye ! harriet exactly . soft is the very word for her eye -- of all epithets , the justest that could be given . thy ready wit the word will soon supply . humph -- harriet \\' s ready wit ! all the better . a man must be very much in love , indeed , to describe her so . ah ! mr . knightley , i wish you had the benefit of this ; i think this would convince you . for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken . an excellent charade indeed ! and very much to the purpose . things must come to a crisis soon now . she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations , which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length , by the eagerness of harriet \\' s wondering questions . \" what can it be , miss woodhouse ?-- what can it be ? i have not an idea -- i cannot guess it in the least . what can it possibly be ? do try to find it out , miss woodhouse . do help me . i never saw any thing so hard . is it kingdom ? i wonder who the friend was -- and who could be the young lady . do you think it is a good one ? can it be woman ? and woman , lovely woman , reigns alone . can it be neptune ? behold him there , the monarch of the seas ! or a trident ? or a mermaid ? or a shark ? oh , no ! shark is only one syllable . it must be very clever , or he would not have brought it . oh ! miss woodhouse , do you think we shall ever find it out ?\" \" mermaids and sharks ! nonsense ! my dear harriet , what are you thinking of ? where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark ? give me the paper and listen . for miss ----------, read miss smith . my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , lords of the earth ! their luxury and ease . that is _court_ . another view of man , my second brings ;

but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you . yes , harriet , just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened . i could never tell whether an attachment between you and mr . elton were most desirable or most natural . its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other ! i am very happy . i congratulate you , my dear harriet , with all my heart . this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating . this is a connexion which offers nothing but good . it will give you every thing that you want -- consideration , independence , a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever . this , harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us .\" \" dear miss woodhouse !\"-- and \" dear miss woodhouse ,\" was all that harriet , with many tender embraces could articulate at first ; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation , it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw , felt , anticipated , and remembered just as she ought . mr . elton \\' s superiority had very ample acknowledgment . \" whatever you say is always right ,\" cried harriet , \" and therefore i suppose , and believe , and hope it must be so ; but otherwise i could not have imagined it . it is so much beyond any thing i deserve . mr . elton , who might marry any body ! there cannot be two opinions about _him_ . he is so very superior . only think of those sweet verses --` to miss --------.\\' dear me , how clever !-- could it really be meant for me ?\" \" i cannot make a question , or listen to a question about that . it is a certainty . receive it on my judgment . it is a sort of prologue to the play , a motto to the chapter ;

it is out of the common course that what is so evidently , so palpably desirable -- what courts the pre - arrangement of other people , should so immediately shape itself into the proper form . you and mr . elton are by situation called together ; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes . your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls . there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction , and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow . the course of true love never did run smooth -- a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage .\" \" that mr . elton should really be in love with me ,-- me , of all people , who did not know him , to speak to him , at michaelmas ! and he , the very handsomest man that ever was , and a man that every body looks up to , quite like mr . knightley ! his company so sought after , that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it ; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week . and so excellent in the church ! miss nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury . dear me ! when i look back to the first time i saw him ! how little did i think !-- the two abbots and i ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and miss nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ;

and another , to write verses and charades like this .\" emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of mr . martin \\' s prose . \" such sweet lines !\" continued harriet --\" these two last !-- but how shall i ever be able to return the paper , or say i have found it out ?-- oh ! miss woodhouse , what can we do about that ?\" \" leave it to me . you do nothing . he will be here this evening , i dare say , and then i will give it him back , and some nonsense or other will pass between us , and you shall not be committed .-- your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming . trust to me .\" \" oh ! miss woodhouse , what a pity that i must not write this beautiful charade into my book ! i am sure i have not got one half so good .\" \" leave out the two last lines , and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book .\" \" oh ! but those two lines are \"-- --\" the best of all . granted ;-- for private enjoyment ;

\" a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better i shall be pleased . but here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him . it will be giving him so much pleasure ! he loves any thing of the sort , and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment . he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all !-- you must let me read it to him .\" harriet looked grave . \" my dear harriet , you must not refine too much upon this charade .-- you will betray your feelings improperly , if you are too conscious and too quick , and appear to affix more meaning , or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it . do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration . if he had been anxious for secrecy , he would not have left the paper while i was by ;

the room she always has ;-- and there is the nursery for the children ,-- just as usual , you know . why should there be any change ?\" \" i do not know , my dear -- but it is so long since she was here !-- not since last easter , and then only for a few days .-- mr . john knightley \\' s being a lawyer is very inconvenient .-- poor isabella !-- she is sadly taken away from us all !-- and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see miss taylor here !\" \" she will not be surprized , papa , at least .\" \" i do not know , my dear . i am sure i was very much surprized when i first heard she was going to be married .\" \" we must ask mr . and mrs . weston to dine with us , while isabella is here .\" \" yes , my dear , if there is time .-- but --( in a very depressed tone )-- she is coming for only one week . there will not be time for any thing .\" \" it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer -- but it seems a case of necessity . mr . john knightley must be in town again on the 28th , and we ought to be thankful , papa , that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country , that two or three days are not to be taken out for the abbey . mr . knightley promises to give up his claim this christmas -- though you know it is longer since they were with him , than with us .\" \" it would be very hard , indeed , my dear , if poor isabella were to be anywhere but at hartfield .\" mr . woodhouse could never allow for mr . knightley \\' s claims on his brother , or any body \\' s claims on isabella , except his own . he sat musing a little while , and then said , \" but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does . i think , emma , i shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us . she and the children might stay very well .\" \" ah ! papa -- that is what you never have been able to accomplish , and i do not think you ever will . isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband .\" this was too true for contradiction . unwelcome as it was , mr . woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter \\' s attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them . \" harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here . i am sure she will be pleased with the children . we are very proud of the children , are not we , papa ? i wonder which she will think the handsomest , henry or john ?\" \" aye , i wonder which she will . poor little dears , how glad they will be to come . they are very fond of being at hartfield , harriet .\" \" i dare say they are , sir . i am sure i do not know who is not .\" \" henry is a fine boy , but john is very like his mama . henry is the eldest , he was named after me , not after his father . john , the second , is named after his father . some people are surprized , i believe , that the eldest was not , but isabella would have him called henry , which i thought very pretty of her . and he is a very clever boy , indeed . they are all remarkably clever ; and they have so many pretty ways . they will come and stand by my chair , and say , ` grandpapa , can you give me a bit of string ?\\' and once henry asked me for a knife , but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas . i think their father is too rough with them very often .\" \" he appears rough to you ,\" said emma , \" because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough . he wishes his boys to be active and hardy ; and if they misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and then ; but he is an affectionate father -- certainly mr . john knightley is an affectionate father . the children are all fond of him .\" \" and then their uncle comes in , and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way !\" \" but they like it , papa ; there is nothing they like so much . it is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other .\" \" well , i cannot understand it .\" \" that is the case with us all , papa . one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other .\" later in the morning , and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o \\' clock dinner , the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again . harriet turned away ; but emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up . his ostensible reason , however , was to ask whether mr . woodhouse \\' s party could be made up in the evening without him , or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield . if he were , every thing else must give way ; but otherwise his friend cole had been saying so much about his dining with him -- had made such a point of it , that he had promised him conditionally to come . emma thanked him , but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account ; her father was sure of his rubber . he re - urged -- she re - declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it -- \" oh ! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us ; thank you for the sight of it . we admired it so much , that i have ventured to write it into miss smith \\' s collection . your friend will not take it amiss i hope . of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines .\" mr . elton certainly did not very well know what to say . he looked rather doubtingly -- rather confused ; said something about \" honour ,\"-- glanced at emma and at harriet , and then seeing the book open on the table , took it up , and examined it very attentively . with the view of passing off an awkward moment , emma smilingly said , \" you must make my apologies to your friend ; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two . he may be sure of every woman \\' s approbation while he writes with such gallantry .\" \" i have no hesitation in saying ,\" replied mr . elton , though hesitating a good deal while he spoke ; \" i have no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all as _i_ do -- i have not the smallest doubt that , could he see his little effusion honoured as _i_ see it , ( looking at the book again , and replacing it on the table ), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life .\" after this speech he was gone as soon as possible . emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh . she ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriet \\' s share . chapter x though now the middle of december , there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise ; and on the morrow , emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family , who lived a little way out of highbury . their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane , a lane leading at right angles from the broad , though irregular , main street of the place ; and , as may be inferred , containing the blessed abode of mr . elton . a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed , and then , about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage , an old and not very good house , almost as close to the road as it could be . it had no advantage of situation ; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor ; and , such as it was , there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes .-- emma \\' s remark was -- \" there it is . there go you and your riddle - book one of these days .\"-- harriet \\' s was -- \" oh , what a sweet house !-- how very beautiful !-- there are the yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much .\" \" i do not often walk this way _now_ ,\" said emma , as they proceeded , \" but _then_ there will be an inducement , and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges , gates , pools and pollards of this part of highbury .\" harriet , she found , had never in her life been within side the vicarage , and her curiosity to see it was so extreme , that , considering exteriors and probabilities , emma could only class it , as a proof of love , with mr . elton \\' s seeing ready wit in her . \" i wish we could contrive it ,\" said she ; \" but i cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in ;-- no servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeper -- no message from my father .\" she pondered , but could think of nothing . after a mutual silence of some minutes , harriet thus began again -- \" i do so wonder , miss woodhouse , that you should not be married , or going to be married ! so charming as you are !\"-- emma laughed , and replied , \" my being charming , harriet , is not quite enough to induce me to marry ; i must find other people charming -- one other person at least . and i am not only , not going to be married , at present , but have very little intention of ever marrying at all .\" \" ah !-- so you say ; but i cannot believe it .\" \" i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet , to be tempted ; mr . elton , you know , ( recollecting herself ,) is out of the question : and i do _not_ wish to see any such person . i would rather not be tempted . i cannot really change for the better . if i were to marry , i must expect to repent it .\" \" dear me !-- it is so odd to hear a woman talk so !\"-- \" i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry . were i to fall in love , indeed , it would be a different thing ! but i never have been in love ; it is not my way , or my nature ; and i do not think i ever shall . and , without love , i am sure i should be a fool to change such a situation as mine . fortune i do not want ; employment i do not want ; consequence i do not want : i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband \\' s house as i am of hartfield ; and never , never could i expect to be so truly beloved and important ; so always first and always right in any man \\' s eyes as i am in my father \\' s .\" \" but then , to be an old maid at last , like miss bates !\" \" that is as formidable an image as you could present , harriet ; and if i thought i should ever be like miss bates ! so silly -- so satisfied -- so smiling -- so prosing -- so undistinguishing and unfastidious -- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me , i would marry to - morrow . but between _us_ , i am convinced there never can be any likeness , except in being unmarried .\" \" but still , you will be an old maid ! and that \\' s so dreadful !\" \" never mind , harriet , i shall not be a poor old maid ; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public ! a single woman , with a very narrow income , must be a ridiculous , disagreeable old maid ! the proper sport of boys and girls , but a single woman , of good fortune , is always respectable , and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else . and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first ; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind , and sour the temper . those who can barely live , and who live perforce in a very small , and generally very inferior , society , may well be illiberal and cross . this does not apply , however , to miss bates ; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me ; but , in general , she is very much to the taste of every body , though single and though poor . poverty certainly has not contracted her mind : i really believe , if she had only a shilling in the world , she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it ; and nobody is afraid of her : that is a great charm .\" \" dear me ! but what shall you do ? how shall you employ yourself when you grow old ?\" \" if i know myself , harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and i do not perceive why i should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty . woman \\' s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now ; or with no important variation . if i draw less , i shall read more ; if i give up music , i shall take to carpet - work . and as for objects of interest , objects for the affections , which is in truth the great point of inferiority , the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in _not_ marrying , i shall be very well off , with all the children of a sister i love so much , to care about . there will be enough of them , in all probability , to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need . there will be enough for every hope and every fear ; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent , it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder . my nephews and nieces !-- i shall often have a niece with me .\" \" do you know miss bates \\' s niece ? that is , i know you must have seen her a hundred times -- but are you acquainted ?\" \" oh ! yes ; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to highbury . by the bye , _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece . heaven forbid ! at least , that i should ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together , as she does about jane fairfax . one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax . every letter from her is read forty times over ; her compliments to all friends go round and round again ; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher , or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother , one hears of nothing else for a month . i wish jane fairfax very well ; but she tires me to death .\" they were now approaching the cottage , and all idle topics were superseded . emma was very compassionate ; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness , her counsel and her patience , as from her purse . she understood their ways , could allow for their ignorance and their temptations , had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little ; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy , and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good - will . in the present instance , it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit ; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice , she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to harriet , as they walked away , \" these are the sights , harriet , to do one good . how trifling they make every thing else appear !-- i feel now as if i could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day ; and yet , who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind ?\" \" very true ,\" said harriet . \" poor creatures ! one can think of nothing else .\" \" and really , i do not think the impression will soon be over ,\" said emma , as she crossed the low hedge , and tottering footstep which ended the narrow , slippery path through the cottage garden , and brought them into the lane again . \" i do not think it will ,\" stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place , and recall the still greater within . \" oh ! dear , no ,\" said her companion . they walked on . the lane made a slight bend ; and when that bend was passed , mr . elton was immediately in sight ; and so near as to give emma time only to say farther , \" ah ! harriet , here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts . well , ( smiling ,) i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers , it has done all that is truly important . if we feel for the wretched , enough to do all we can for them , the rest is empty sympathy , only distressing to ourselves .\" harriet could just answer , \" oh ! dear , yes ,\" before the gentleman joined them . the wants and sufferings of the poor family , however , were the first subject on meeting . he had been going to call on them . his visit he would now defer ; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done . mr . elton then turned back to accompany them . \" to fall in with each other on such an errand as this ,\" thought emma ; \" to meet in a charitable scheme ; this will bring a great increase of love on each side . i should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration . it must , if i were not here . i wish i were anywhere else .\" anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could , she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath , a little raised on one side of the lane , leaving them together in the main road . but she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriet \\' s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too , and that , in short , they would both be soon after her . this would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute . they did as they were desired ; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in her power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from hartfield . to walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her . she gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child \\' s pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them . mr . elton was speaking with animation , harriet listening with a very pleased attention ; and emma , having sent the child on , was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more , when they both looked around , and she was obliged to join them . mr . elton was still talking , still engaged in some interesting detail ; and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday \\' s party at his friend cole \\' s , and that she was come in herself for the stilton cheese , the north wiltshire , the butter , the cellery , the beet - root , and all the dessert . \" this would soon have led to something better , of course ,\" was her consoling reflection ; \" any thing interests between those who love ; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart . if i could but have kept longer away !\" they now walked on together quietly , till within view of the vicarage pales , when a sudden resolution , of at least getting harriet into the house , made her again find something very much amiss about her boot , and fall behind to arrange it once more . she then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort . \" part of my lace is gone ,\" said she , \" and i do not know how i am to contrive . i really am a most troublesome companion to you both , but i hope i am not often so ill - equipped . mr . elton , i must beg leave to stop at your house , and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string , or any thing just to keep my boot on .\" mr . elton looked all happiness at this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage . the room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open , and emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner . she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it ; but she fully intended that mr . elton should close it . it was not closed , however , it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room . for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself . it could be protracted no longer . she was then obliged to be finished , and make her appearance . the lovers were standing together at one of the windows . it had a most favourable aspect ; and , for half a minute , emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully . but it would not do ; he had not come to the point . he had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told harriet that he had seen them go by , and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious . \" cautious , very cautious ,\" thought emma ; \" he advances inch by inch , and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure .\" still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event . chapter xi mr . elton must now be left to himself . it was no longer in emma \\' s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures . the coming of her sister \\' s family was so very near at hand , that first in anticipation , and then in reality , it became henceforth her prime object of interest ; and during the ten days of their stay at hartfield it was not to be expected -- she did not herself expect -- that any thing beyond occasional , fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers . they might advance rapidly if they would , however ; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no . she hardly wished to have more leisure for them . there are people , who the more you do for them , the less they will do for themselves . mr . and mrs . john knightley , from having been longer than usual absent from surry , were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest . till this year , every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey ; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea - bathing for the children , and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their surry connexions , or seen at all by mr . woodhouse , who could not be induced to get so far as london , even for poor isabella \\' s sake ; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit . he thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and mr . and mrs . john knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery - maids , all reaching hartfield in safety . the bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by mrs . john knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him , either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them . mrs . john knightley was a pretty , elegant little woman , of gentle , quiet manners , and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate ; wrapt up in her family ; a devoted wife , a doating mother , and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that , but for these higher ties , a warmer love might have seemed impossible . she could never see a fault in any of them . she was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness ; and with this resemblance of her father , she inherited also much of his constitution ; was delicate in her own health , over - careful of that of her children , had many fears and many nerves , and was as fond of her own mr . wingfield in town as her father could be of mr . perry . they were alike too , in a general benevolence of temper , and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance . mr . john knightley was a tall , gentleman - like , and very clever man ; rising in his profession , domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; and capable of being sometimes out of humour . he was not an ill - tempered man , not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach ; but his temper was not his great perfection ; and , indeed , with such a worshipping wife , it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased . the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his . he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing . he was not a great favourite with his fair sister - in - law . nothing wrong in him escaped her . she was quick in feeling the little injuries to isabella , which isabella never felt herself . perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to isabella \\' s sister , but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend , without praise and without blindness ; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into , the want of respectful forbearance towards her father . there he had not always the patience that could have been wished . mr . woodhouse \\' s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill - bestowed . it did not often happen ; for mr . john knightley had really a great regard for his father - in - law , and generally a strong sense of what was due to him ; but it was too often for emma \\' s charity , especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured , though the offence came not . the beginning , however , of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings , and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality . they had not been long seated and composed when mr . woodhouse , with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh , called his daughter \\' s attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last . \" ah , my dear ,\" said he , \" poor miss taylor -- it is a grievous business .\" \" oh yes , sir ,\" cried she with ready sympathy , \" how you must miss her ! and dear emma , too !-- what a dreadful loss to you both !-- i have been so grieved for you .-- i could not imagine how you could possibly do without her .-- it is a sad change indeed .-- but i hope she is pretty well , sir .\" \" pretty well , my dear -- i hope -- pretty well .-- i do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably .\" mr . john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of randalls . \" oh ! no -- none in the least . i never saw mrs . weston better in my life -- never looking so well . papa is only speaking his own regret .\" \" very much to the honour of both ,\" was the handsome reply . \" and do you see her , sir , tolerably often ?\" asked isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father . mr . woodhouse hesitated .--\" not near so often , my dear , as i could wish .\" \" oh ! papa , we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married . either in the morning or evening of every day , excepting one , have we seen either mr . weston or mrs . weston , and generally both , either at randalls or here -- and as you may suppose , isabella , most frequently here . they are very , very kind in their visits . mr . weston is really as kind as herself . papa , if you speak in that melancholy way , you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all . every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed , but every body ought also to be assured that mr . and mrs . weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated -- which is the exact truth .\" \" just as it should be ,\" said mr . john knightley , \" and just as i hoped it was from your letters . her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted , and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy . i have been always telling you , my love , that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended ; and now you have emma \\' s account , i hope you will be satisfied .\" \" why , to be sure ,\" said mr . woodhouse --\" yes , certainly -- i cannot deny that mrs . weston , poor mrs . weston , does come and see us pretty often -- but then -- she is always obliged to go away again .\" \" it would be very hard upon mr . weston if she did not , papa .-- you quite forget poor mr . weston .\" \" i think , indeed ,\" said john knightley pleasantly , \" that mr . weston has some little claim . you and i , emma , will venture to take the part of the poor husband . i , being a husband , and you not being a wife , the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force . as for isabella , she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr . westons aside as much as she can .\" \" me , my love ,\" cried his wife , hearing and understanding only in part .-- \" are you talking about me ?-- i am sure nobody ought to be , or can be , a greater advocate for matrimony than i am ; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield , i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world ; and as to slighting mr . weston , that excellent mr . weston , i think there is nothing he does not deserve . i believe he is one of the very best - tempered men that ever existed . excepting yourself and your brother , i do not know his equal for temper . i shall never forget his flying henry \\' s kite for him that very windy day last easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o \\' clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham , i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence .-- if any body can deserve him , it must be miss taylor .\" \" where is the young man ?\" said john knightley . \" has he been here on this occasion -- or has he not ?\" \" he has not been here yet ,\" replied emma . \" there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage , but it ended in nothing ; and i have not heard him mentioned lately .\" \" but you should tell them of the letter , my dear ,\" said her father . \" he wrote a letter to poor mrs . weston , to congratulate her , and a very proper , handsome letter it was . she shewed it to me . i thought it very well done of him indeed . whether it was his own idea you know , one cannot tell . he is but young , and his uncle , perhaps --\" \" my dear papa , he is three - and - twenty . you forget how time passes .\" \" three - and - twenty !-- is he indeed ?-- well , i could not have thought it -- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother ! well , time does fly indeed !-- and my memory is very bad . however , it was an exceeding good , pretty letter , and gave mr . and mrs . weston a great deal of pleasure . i remember it was written from weymouth , and dated sept . 28th -- and began , ` my dear madam ,\\' but i forget how it went on ; and it was signed ` f . c . weston churchill .\\'-- i remember that perfectly .\" \" how very pleasing and proper of him !\" cried the good - hearted mrs . john knightley . \" i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man . but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father ! there is something so shocking in a child \\' s being taken away from his parents and natural home ! i never could comprehend how mr . weston could part with him . to give up one \\' s child ! i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else .\" \" nobody ever did think well of the churchills , i fancy ,\" observed mr . john knightley coolly . \" but you need not imagine mr . weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john . mr . weston is rather an easy , cheerful - tempered man , than a man of strong feelings ; he takes things as he finds them , and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other , depending , i suspect , much more upon what is called society for his comforts , that is , upon the power of eating and drinking , and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week , than upon family affection , or any thing that home affords .\" emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr . weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass . she would keep the peace if possible ; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits , the all - sufficiency of home to himself , whence resulted her brother \\' s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse , and those to whom it was important .-- it had a high claim to forbearance . chapter xii mr . knightley was to dine with them -- rather against the inclination of mr . woodhouse , who did not like that any one should share with him in isabella \\' s first day . emma \\' s sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between mr . knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation . she hoped they might now become friends again . she thought it was time to make up . making - up indeed would not do . _she_ certainly had not been in the wrong , and _he_ would never own that he had . concession must be out of the question ; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled ; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship , that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her -- the youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old , who was now making her first visit to hartfield , and very happy to be danced about in her aunt \\' s arms . it did assist ; for though he began with grave looks and short questions , he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way , and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity . emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby , \" what a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces . as to men and women , our opinions are sometimes very different ; but with regard to these children , i observe we never disagree .\" \" if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women , and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them , as you are where these children are concerned , we might always think alike .\" \" to be sure -- our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong .\" \" yes ,\" said he , smiling --\" and reason good . i was sixteen years old when you were born .\" \" a material difference then ,\" she replied --\" and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives ; but does not the lapse of one - and - twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer ?\" \" yes -- a good deal _nearer_ .\" \" but still , not near enough to give me a chance of being right , if we think differently .\" \" i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years \\' experience , and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child . come , my dear emma , let us be friends , and say no more about it . tell your aunt , little emma , that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances , and that if she were not wrong before , she is now .\" \" that \\' s true ,\" she cried --\" very true . little emma , grow up a better woman than your aunt . be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited . now , mr . knightley , a word or two more , and i have done . as far as good intentions went , we were _both_ right , and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong . i only want to know that mr . martin is not very , very bitterly disappointed .\" \" a man cannot be more so ,\" was his short , full answer . \" ah !-- indeed i am very sorry .-- come , shake hands with me .\" this had just taken place and with great cordiality , when john knightley made his appearance , and \" how d \\' ye do , george ?\" and \" john , how are you ?\" succeeded in the true english style , burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference , the real attachment which would have led either of them , if requisite , to do every thing for the good of the other . the evening was quiet and conversable , as mr . woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two mr . knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing -- and emma only occasionally joining in one or the other . the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits , but principally of those of the elder , whose temper was by much the most communicative , and who was always the greater talker . as a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult john about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong . the plan of a drain , the change of a fence , the felling of a tree , and the destination of every acre for wheat , turnips , or spring corn , was entered into with as much equality of interest by john , as his cooler manners rendered possible ; and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about , his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness . while they were thus comfortably occupied , mr . woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter . \" my poor dear isabella ,\" said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children --\" how long it is , how terribly long since you were here ! and how tired you must be after your journey ! you must go to bed early , my dear -- and i recommend a little gruel to you before you go .-- you and i will have a nice basin of gruel together . my dear emma , suppose we all have a little gruel .\" emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the mr . knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself ;-- and two basins only were ordered . after a little more discourse in praise of gruel , with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body , he proceeded to say , with an air of grave reflection , \" it was an awkward business , my dear , your spending the autumn at south end instead of coming here . i never had much opinion of the sea air .\" \" mr . wingfield most strenuously recommended it , sir -- or we should not have gone . he recommended it for all the children , but particularly for the weakness in little bella \\' s throat ,-- both sea air and bathing .\" \" ah ! my dear , but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good ; and as to myself , i have been long perfectly convinced , though perhaps i never told you so before , that the sea is very rarely of use to any body . i am sure it almost killed me once .\" \" come , come ,\" cried emma , feeling this to be an unsafe subject , \" i must beg you not to talk of the sea . it makes me envious and miserable ;-- i who have never seen it ! south end is prohibited , if you please . my dear isabella , i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr . perry yet ; and he never forgets you .\" \" oh ! good mr . perry -- how is he , sir ?\" \" why , pretty well ; but not quite well . poor perry is bilious , and he has not time to take care of himself -- he tells me he has not time to take care of himself -- which is very sad -- but he is always wanted all round the country . i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere . but then there is not so clever a man any where .\" \" and mrs . perry and the children , how are they ? do the children grow ? i have a great regard for mr . perry . i hope he will be calling soon . he will be so pleased to see my little ones .\" \" i hope he will be here to - morrow , for i have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence . and , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little bella \\' s throat .\" \" oh ! my dear sir , her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it . either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr . wingfield \\' s , which we have been applying at times ever since august .\" \" it is not very likely , my dear , that bathing should have been of use to her -- and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation , i would have spoken to -- \" you seem to me to have forgotten mrs . and miss bates ,\" said emma , \" i have not heard one inquiry after them .\" \" oh ! the good bateses -- i am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters . i hope they are quite well . good old mrs . bates -- i will call upon her to - morrow , and take my children .-- they are always so pleased to see my children .-- and that excellent miss bates !-- such thorough worthy people !-- how are they , sir ?\" \" why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole . but poor mrs . bates had a bad cold about a month ago .\" \" how sorry i am ! but colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn . mr . wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy -- except when it has been quite an influenza .\" \" that has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention . perry says that colds have been very general , but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november . perry does not call it altogether a sickly season .\" \" no , i do not know that mr . wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except -- \" ah ! my poor dear child , the truth is , that in london it is always a sickly season . nobody is healthy in london , nobody can be . it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there ! so far off !-- and the air so bad !\" \" no , indeed -- _we_ are not at all in a bad air . our part of london is very superior to most others !-- you must not confound us with london in general , my dear sir . the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very different from almost all the rest . we are so very airy ! i should be unwilling , i own , to live in any other part of the town ;-- there is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my children in : but _we_ are so remarkably airy !-- mr . wingfield thinks the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as to air .\" \" ah ! my dear , it is not like hartfield . you make the best of it -- but after you have been a week at hartfield , you are all of you different creatures ; you do not look like the same . now i cannot say , that i think you are any of you looking well at present .\" \" i am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but i assure you , excepting those little nervous head - aches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere , i am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming . i hope you will think better of their looks to - morrow ; for i assure you mr . wingfield told me , that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether , in such good case . i trust , at least , that you do not think mr . knightley looking ill ,\" turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband . \" middling , my dear ; i cannot compliment you . i think mr . john knightley very far from looking well .\" \" what is the matter , sir ?-- did you speak to me ?\" cried mr . john knightley , hearing his own name . \" i am sorry to find , my love , that my father does not think you looking well -- but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued . i could have wished , however , as you know , that you had seen mr . wingfield before you left home .\" \" my dear isabella ,\"-- exclaimed he hastily --\" pray do not concern yourself about my looks . be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children , and let me look as i chuse .\" \" i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother ,\" cried emma , \" about your friend mr . graham \\' s intending to have a bailiff from scotland , to look after his new estate . what will it answer ? will not the old prejudice be too strong ?\" and she talked in this way so long and successfully that , when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister , she had nothing worse to hear than isabella \\' s kind inquiry after jane fairfax ; and jane fairfax , though no great favourite with her in general , she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising . \" that sweet , amiable jane fairfax !\" said mrs . john knightley .-- \" it is so long since i have seen her , except now and then for a moment accidentally in town ! what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt , when she comes to visit them ! i always regret excessively on dear emma \\' s account that she cannot be more at highbury ; but now their daughter is married , i suppose colonel and mrs . campbell will not be able to part with her at all . she would be such a delightful companion for emma .\" mr . woodhouse agreed to it all , but added , \" our little friend harriet smith , however , is just such another pretty kind of young person . you will like harriet . emma could not have a better companion than harriet .\" \" i am most happy to hear it -- but only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior !-- and exactly emma \\' s age .\" this topic was discussed very happily , and others succeeded of similar moment , and passed away with similar harmony ; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation . the gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments -- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable ;-- but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at south end , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin . often as she had wished for and ordered it , she had never been able to get any thing tolerable . here was a dangerous opening . \" ah !\" said mr . woodhouse , shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern .-- the ejaculation in emma \\' s ear expressed , \" ah ! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to south end . it does not bear talking of .\" and for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it , and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel . after an interval of some minutes , however , he began with , \" i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn , instead of coming here .\" \" but why should you be sorry , sir ?-- i assure you , it did the children a great deal of good .\" \" and , moreover , if you must go to the sea , it had better not have been to south end . south end is an unhealthy place . perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end .\" \" i know there is such an idea with many people , but indeed it is quite a mistake , sir .-- we all had our health perfectly well there , never found the least inconvenience from the mud ; and mr . wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy ; and i am sure he may be depended on , for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air , and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly .\" \" you should have gone to cromer , my dear , if you went anywhere .-- perry was a week at cromer once , and he holds it to be the best of all the sea - bathing places . a fine open sea , he says , and very pure air . and , by what i understand , you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea -- a quarter of a mile off -- very comfortable . you should have consulted perry .\" \" but , my dear sir , the difference of the journey ;-- only consider how great it would have been .-- an hundred miles , perhaps , instead of forty .\" \" ah ! my dear , as perry says , where health is at stake , nothing else should be considered ; and if one is to travel , there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred .-- better not move at all , better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air . this is just what perry said . it seemed to him a very ill - judged measure .\" emma \\' s attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother - in - law \\' s breaking out . \" mr . perry ,\" said he , in a voice of very strong displeasure , \" would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for . why does he make it any business of his , to wonder at what i do ?-- at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another ?-- i may be allowed , i hope , the use of my judgment as well as mr . perry .-- i want his directions no more than his drugs .\" he paused -- and growing cooler in a moment , added , with only sarcastic dryness , \" if mr . perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty , i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself .\" \" true , true ,\" cried mr . knightley , with most ready interposition -- \" very true . that \\' s a consideration indeed .-- but john , as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham , of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows , i cannot conceive any difficulty . i should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path . . . . the only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps . i shall see you at the abbey to - morrow morning i hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion .\" mr . woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend perry , to whom he had , in fact , though unconsciously , been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions ;-- but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil , and the immediate alertness of one brother , and better recollections of the other , prevented any renewal of it . chapter xiii there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs . john knightley , in this short visit to hartfield , going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children , and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister . she had nothing to wish otherwise , but that the days did not pass so swiftly . it was a delightful visit ;-- perfect , in being much too short . in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings ; but one complete dinner engagement , and out of the house too , there was no avoiding , though at christmas . mr . weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at randalls one day ;-- even mr . woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party . how they were all to be conveyed , he would have made a difficulty if he could , but as his son and daughter \\' s carriage and horses were actually at hartfield , he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ; it hardly amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for harriet also . harriet , mr . elton , and mr . knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them ;-- the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; mr . woodhouse \\' s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing . the evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that mr . woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of december ) had been spent by harriet at hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by mrs . goddard , emma could not have allowed her to leave the house . emma called on her the next day , and found her doom already signed with regard to randalls . she was very feverish and had a bad sore throat : mrs . goddard was full of care and affection , mr . perry was talked of , and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement , though she could not speak of her loss without many tears . emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in mrs . goddard \\' s unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much mr . elton \\' s would be depressed when he knew her state ; and left her at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit , and of their all missing her very much . she had not advanced many yards from mrs . goddard \\' s door , when she was met by mr . elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid -- of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to hartfield -- they were overtaken by mr . john knightley returning from the daily visit to donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for . they joined company and proceeded together . emma was just describing the nature of her friend \\' s complaint ;-- \" a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c . and she was sorry to find from mrs . goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them .\" mr . elton looked all alarm on the occasion , as he exclaimed , \" a sore - throat !-- i hope not infectious . i hope not of a putrid infectious sort . has perry seen her ? indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend . let me entreat you to run no risks . why does not perry see her ?\" emma , who was not really at all frightened herself , tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of mrs . goddard \\' s experience and care ; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away , which she would rather feed and assist than not , she added soon afterwards -- as if quite another subject , \" it is so cold , so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , i should really try not to go out to - day -- and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , i do not like to interfere , as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr . and mrs . weston . but , upon my word , mr . elton , in your case , i should certainly excuse myself . you appear to me a little hoarse already , and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to - morrow will bring , i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to - night .\" mr . elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make ; which was exactly the case ; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady , and not liking to resist any advice of her \\' s , he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit ;-- but emma , too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially , or see him with clear vision , was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being \" very cold , certainly very cold ,\" and walked on , rejoicing in having extricated him from randalls , and secured him the power of sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening . \" you do quite right ,\" said she ;--\" we will make your apologies to mr . and mrs . weston .\" but hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were mr . elton \\' s only objection , and mr . elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction . it was a done thing ; mr . elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her . \" well ,\" said she to herself , \" this is most strange !-- after i had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave harriet ill behind !-- most strange indeed !-- but there is , i believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination -- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with mr . elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with harriet ; but still , he cannot refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked . what a strange thing love is ! he can see ready wit in harriet , but will not dine alone for her .\" soon afterwards mr . elton quitted them , and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming harriet at parting ; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at mrs . goddard \\' s for news of her fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped to be able to give a better report ; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour . after a few minutes of entire silence between them , john knightley began with -- \" i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr . elton . it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned . with men he can be rational and unaffected , but when he has ladies to please , every feature works .\" \" mr . elton \\' s manners are not perfect ,\" replied emma ; \" but where there is a wish to please , one ought to overlook , and one does overlook a great deal . where a man does his best with only moderate powers , he will have the advantage over negligent superiority . there is such perfect good - temper and good - will in mr . elton as one cannot but value .\" \" yes ,\" said mr . john knightley presently , with some slyness , \" he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you .\" \" me !\" she replied with a smile of astonishment , \" are you imagining me to be mr . elton \\' s object ?\" \" such an imagination has crossed me , i own , emma ; and if it never occurred to you before , you may as well take it into consideration now .\" \" mr . elton in love with me !-- what an idea !\" \" i do not say it is so ; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not , and to regulate your behaviour accordingly . i think your manners to him encouraging . i speak as a friend , emma . you had better look about you , and ascertain what you do , and what you mean to do .\" \" i thank you ; but i assure you you are quite mistaken . mr . elton and i are very good friends , and nothing more ;\" and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel . he said no more . mr . woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit , that in spite of the increasing coldness , he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it , and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage , with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others ; too full of the wonder of his own going , and the pleasure it was to afford at randalls to see that it was cold , and too well wrapt up to feel it . the cold , however , was severe ; and by the time the second carriage was in motion , a few flakes of snow were finding their way down , and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time . emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour . the preparing and the going abroad in such weather , with the sacrifice of his children after dinner , were evils , were disagreeables at least , which mr . john knightley did not by any means like ; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase ; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent . \" a man ,\" said he , \" must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him . he must think himself a most agreeable fellow ; i could not do such a thing . it is the greatest absurdity -- actually snowing at this moment !-- the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home -- and the folly of people \\' s not staying comfortably at home when they can ! if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it ;-- and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can ;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man \\' s house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to - morrow . going in dismal weather , to return probably in worse ;-- four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle , shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home .\" emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the \" very true , my love ,\" which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all . she could not be complying , she dreaded being quarrelsome ; her heroism reached only to silence . she allowed him to talk , and arranged the glasses , and wrapped herself up , without opening her lips . they arrived , the carriage turned , the step was let down , and mr . elton , spruce , black , and smiling , was with them instantly . emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject . mr . elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that she began to think he must have received a different account of harriet from what had reached her . she had sent while dressing , and the answer had been , \" much the same -- not better .\" \" _my_ report from mrs . goddard \\' s ,\" said she presently , \" was not so pleasant as i had hoped --` not better \\' was _my_ answer .\" his face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered . \" oh ! no -- i am grieved to find -- i was on the point of telling you that when i called at mrs . goddard \\' s door , which i did the very last thing before i returned to dress , i was told that miss smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse . very much grieved and concerned -- i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morning .\" emma smiled and answered --\" my visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , i hope ; but not even i can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed . mr . perry has been with her , as you probably heard .\" \" yes -- i imagined -- that is -- i did not --\" \" he has been used to her in these complaints , and i hope to - morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report . but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness . such a sad loss to our party to - day !\" \" dreadful !-- exactly so , indeed .-- she will be missed every moment .\" this was very proper ; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable ; but it should have lasted longer . emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things , and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment . \" what an excellent device ,\" said he , \" the use of a sheepskin for carriages . how very comfortable they make it ;-- impossible to feel cold with such precautions . the contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman \\' s carriage perfectly complete . one is so fenced and guarded from the weather , that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted . weather becomes absolutely of no consequence . it is a very cold afternoon -- but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter .-- ha ! snows a little i see .\" \" yes ,\" said john knightley , \" and i think we shall have a good deal of it .\" \" christmas weather ,\" observed mr . elton . \" quite seasonable ; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day \\' s party , which it might very possibly have done , for mr . woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground ; but now it is of no consequence . this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings . at christmas every body invites their friends about them , and people think little of even the worst weather . i was snowed up at a friend \\' s house once for a week . nothing could be pleasanter . i went for only one night , and could not get away till that very day se \\' nnight .\" mr . john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure , but said only , coolly , \" i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls .\" at another time emma might have been amused , but she was too much astonished now at mr . elton \\' s spirits for other feelings . harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party . \" we are sure of excellent fires ,\" continued he , \" and every thing in the greatest comfort . charming people , mr . and mrs . weston ;-- mrs . weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society ;-- it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any . mr . weston \\' s dining - room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably ; and for my part , i would rather , under such circumstances , fall short by two than exceed by two . i think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to emma ,) i think i shall certainly have your approbation , though mr . knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of london , may not quite enter into our feelings .\" \" i know nothing of the large parties of london , sir -- i never dine with any body .\" \" indeed ! ( in a tone of wonder and pity ,) i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery . well , sir , the time must come when you will be paid for all this , when you will have little labour and great enjoyment .\" \" my first enjoyment ,\" replied john knightley , as they passed through the sweep - gate , \" will be to find myself safe at hartfield again .\" chapter xiv some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs . weston \\' s drawing - room ;-- mr . elton must compose his joyous looks , and mr . john knightley disperse his ill - humour . mr . elton must smile less , and mr . john knightley more , to fit them for the place .-- emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was . to her it was real enjoyment to be with the westons . mr . weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself . she could tell nothing of hartfield , in which mrs . weston had not a lively concern ; and half an hour \\' s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends , was one of the first gratifications of each . this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day \\' s visit might not afford , which certainly did not belong to the present half - hour ; but the very sight of mrs . weston , her smile , her touch , her voice was grateful to emma , and she determined to think as little as possible of mr . elton \\' s oddities , or of any thing else unpleasant , and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost . the misfortune of harriet \\' s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival . mr . woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and isabella \\' s coming , and of emma \\' s being to follow , and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and mrs . weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma . emma \\' s project of forgetting mr . elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her . the difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion . instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of \" can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me ?-- absurd and insufferable !\"-- yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with mrs . weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners . for her own sake she could not be rude ; and for harriet \\' s , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of mr . elton \\' s nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to . she heard enough to know that mr . weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words \" my son ,\" and \" frank ,\" and \" my son ,\" repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet mr . elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward . now , it so happened that in spite of emma \\' s resolution of never marrying , there was something in the name , in the idea of mr . frank churchill , which always interested her . she had frequently thought -- especially since his father \\' s marriage with miss taylor -- that if she _were_ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition . he seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her . she could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of . that mr . and mrs . weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends \\' imaginations . with such sensations , mr . elton \\' s civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted mr . weston .-- so it proved ;-- for when happily released from mr . elton , and seated by mr . weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her , \" we want only two more to be just the right number . i should like to see two more here ,-- your pretty little friend , miss smith , and my son -- and then i should say we were quite complete . i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting frank . i had a letter from him this morning , and he will be with us within a fortnight .\" emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure ; and fully assented to his proposition of mr . frank churchill and miss smith making their party quite complete . \" he has been wanting to come to us ,\" continued mr . weston , \" ever since september : every letter has been full of it ; but he cannot command his own time . he has those to please who must be pleased , and who ( between ourselves ) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices . but now i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january .\" \" what a very great pleasure it will be to you ! and mrs . weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him , that she must be almost as happy as yourself .\" \" yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off . she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do : but she does not know the parties so well as i do . the case , you see , is --( but this is quite between ourselves : i did not mention a syllable of it in the other room . there are secrets in all families , you know )-- the case is , that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at enscombe in january ; and that frank \\' s coming depends upon their being put off . if they are not put off , he cannot stir . but i know they will , because it is a family that a certain lady , of some consequence , at enscombe , has a particular dislike to : and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years , they always are put off when it comes to the point . i have not the smallest doubt of the issue . i am as confident of seeing frank here before the middle of january , as i am of being here myself : but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself , and has been so little used to them at hartfield , that she cannot calculate on their effects , as i have been long in the practice of doing .\" \" i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case ,\" replied emma ; \" but am disposed to side with you , mr . weston . if you think he will come , i shall think so too ; for you know enscombe .\" \" yes -- i have some right to that knowledge ; though i have never been at the place in my life .-- she is an odd woman !-- but i never allow myself to speak ill of her , on frank \\' s account ; for i do believe her to be very fond of him . i used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body , except herself : but she has always been kind to him ( in her way -- allowing for little whims and caprices , and expecting every thing to be as she likes ). and it is no small credit , in my opinion , to him , that he should excite such an affection ; for , though i would not say it to any body else , she has no more heart than a stone to people in general ; and the devil of a temper .\" emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to mrs . weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing - room : wishing her joy -- yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming .-- mrs . weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : \" for i cannot depend upon his coming . i cannot be so sanguine as mr . weston . i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing . mr . weston , i dare say , has been telling you exactly how the matter stands ?\" \" yes -- it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill - humour of mrs . churchill , which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world .\" \" my emma !\" replied mrs . weston , smiling , \" what is the certainty of caprice ?\" then turning to isabella , who had not been attending before --\" you must know , my dear mrs . knightley , that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr . frank churchill , in my opinion , as his father thinks . it depends entirely upon his aunt \\' s spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper . to you -- to my two daughters -- i may venture on the truth . mrs . churchill rules at enscombe , and is a very odd - tempered woman ; and his coming now , depends upon her being willing to spare him .\" \" oh , mrs . churchill ; every body knows mrs . churchill ,\" replied isabella : \" and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion . to be constantly living with an ill - tempered person , must be dreadful . it is what we happily have never known any thing of ; but it must be a life of misery . what a blessing , that she never had any children ! poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them !\" emma wished she had been alone with mrs . weston . she should then have heard more : mrs . weston would speak to her , with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with isabella ; and , she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills from her , excepting those views on the young man , of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge . but at present there was nothing more to be said . mr . woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing - room . to be sitting long after dinner , was a confinement that he could not endure . neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him ; and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable . while he talked to isabella , however , emma found an opportunity of saying , \" and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain . i am sorry for it . the introduction must be unpleasant , whenever it takes place ; and the sooner it could be over , the better .\" \" yes ; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays . even if this family , the braithwaites , are put off , i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us . i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills \\' to keep him to themselves . there is jealousy . they are jealous even of his regard for his father . in short , i can feel no dependence on his coming , and i wish mr . weston were less sanguine .\" \" he ought to come ,\" said emma . \" if he could stay only a couple of days , he ought to come ; and one can hardly conceive a young man \\' s not having it in his power to do as much as that . a young _woman_ , if she fall into bad hands , may be teazed , and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with ; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_ \\' s being under such restraint , as not to be able to spend a week with his father , if he likes it .\" \" one ought to be at enscombe , and know the ways of the family , before one decides upon what he can do ,\" replied mrs . weston . \" one ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but enscombe , i believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _she_ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her .\" \" but she is so fond of the nephew : he is so very great a favourite . now , according to my idea of mrs . churchill , it would be most natural , that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband , to whom she owes every thing , while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_ , she should frequently be governed by the nephew , to whom she owes nothing at all .\" \" my dearest emma , do not pretend , with your sweet temper , to understand a bad one , or to lay down rules for it : you must let it go its own way . i have no doubt of his having , at times , considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will be .\" emma listened , and then coolly said , \" i shall not be satisfied , unless he comes .\" \" he may have a great deal of influence on some points ,\" continued mrs . weston , \" and on others , very little : and among those , on which she is beyond his reach , it is but too likely , may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us .\" chapter xv mr . woodhouse was soon ready for his tea ; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home ; and it was as much as his three companions could do , to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour , before the other gentlemen appeared . mr . weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation . mr . elton , in very good spirits , was one of the first to walk in . mrs . weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa . he joined them immediately , and , with scarcely an invitation , seated himself between them . emma , in good spirits too , from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of mr . frank churchill , was willing to forget his late improprieties , and be as well satisfied with him as before , and on his making harriet his very first subject , was ready to listen with most friendly smiles . he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend -- her fair , lovely , amiable friend . \" did she know ?-- had she heard any thing about her , since their being at randalls ?-- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably .\" and in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and emma was quite in charity with him . but at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on harriet \\' s -- more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint . he began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr . perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her . she was vexed . it did appear -- there was no concealing it -- exactly like the pretence of being in love with her , instead of harriet ; an inconstancy , if real , the most contemptible and abominable ! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper . he turned to mrs . weston to implore her assistance , \" would not she give him her support ?-- would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce miss woodhouse not to go to mrs . goddard \\' s till it were certain that miss smith \\' s disorder had no infection ? he could not be satisfied without a promise -- would not she give him her influence in procuring it ?\" \" so scrupulous for others ,\" he continued , \" and yet so careless for herself ! she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to - day , and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself . is this fair , mrs . weston ?-- judge between us . have not i some right to complain ? i am sure of your kind support and aid .\" emma saw mrs . weston \\' s surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose . she could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention . she had not time to know how mr . elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for mr . john knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to mr . woodhouse : \" this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir . something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow .\" poor mr . woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer . mrs . weston and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son - in - law , who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly . \" i admired your resolution very much , sir ,\" said he , \" in venturing out in such weather , for of course you saw there would be snow very soon . every body must have seen the snow coming on . i admired your spirit ; and i dare say we shall get home very well . another hour or two \\' s snow can hardly make the road impassable ; and we are two carriages ; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand . i dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight .\" mr . weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make mr . woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away . as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return , that was a mere joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty . he wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at randalls ; and with the utmost good - will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house . \" what is to be done , my dear emma ?-- what is to be done ?\" was mr . woodhouse \\' s first exclamation , and all that he could say for some time . to her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of james , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little . his eldest daughter \\' s alarm was equal to his own . the horror of being blocked up at randalls , while her children were at hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and emma should remain at randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them . \" you had better order the carriage directly , my love ,\" said she ; \" i dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , i can get out and walk . i am not at all afraid . i should not mind walking half the way . i could change my shoes , you know , the moment i got home ; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold .\" \" indeed !\" replied he . \" then , my dear isabella , it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world , for in general every thing does give you cold . walk home !-- you are prettily shod for walking home , i dare say . it will be bad enough for the horses .\" isabella turned to mrs . weston for her approbation of the plan . mrs . weston could only approve . isabella then went to emma ; but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away ; and they were still discussing the point , when mr . knightley , who had left the room immediately after his brother \\' s first report of the snow , came back again , and told them that he had been out of doors to examine , and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home , whenever they liked it , either now or an hour hence . he had gone beyond the sweep -- some way along the highbury road -- the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep -- in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground ; a very few flakes were falling at present , but the clouds were parting , and there was every appearance of its being soon over . he had seen the coachmen , and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend . to isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to emma on her father \\' s account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at randalls . he was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , mr . knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus -- \" your father will not be easy ; why do not you go ?\" \" i am ready , if the others are .\" \" shall i ring the bell ?\" \" yes , do .\" and the bell was rung , and the carriages spoken for . a few minutes more , and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over . the carriage came : and mr . woodhouse , always the first object on such occasions , was carefully attended to his own by mr . knightley and mr . weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for . \" he was afraid they should have a very bad drive . he was afraid poor isabella would not like it . and there would be poor emma in the carriage behind . he did not know what they had best do . they must keep as much together as they could ;\" and james was talked to , and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage . isabella stept in after her father ; john knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by mr . elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tete - a - tete drive . it would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have seemed but one . but now , she would rather it had not happened . she believed he had been drinking too much of mr . weston \\' s good wine , and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense . to restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up -- her hand seized -- her attention demanded , and mr . elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping -- fearing -- adoring -- ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible . it really was so . without scruple -- without apology -- without much apparent diffidence , mr . elton , the lover of harriet , was professing himself _her_ lover . she tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all . angry as she was , the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak . she felt that half this folly must be drunkenness , and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour . accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied , \" i am very much astonished , mr . elton . this to _me_ ! you forget yourself -- you take me for my friend -- any message to miss smith i shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _me_ , if you please .\" \" miss smith !-- message to miss smith !-- what could she possibly mean !\"-- and he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness , \" mr . elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct ! and i can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of harriet , in such a manner . command yourself enough to say no more , and i will endeavour to forget it .\" but mr . elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits , not at all to confuse his intellects . he perfectly knew his own meaning ; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious , and slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friend ,-- but acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned at all ,-- he resumed the subject of his own passion , and was very urgent for a favourable answer . as she thought less of his inebriety , she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption ; and with fewer struggles for politeness , replied , \" it is impossible for me to doubt any longer . you have made yourself too clear . mr . elton , my astonishment is much beyond any thing i can express . after such behaviour , as i have witnessed during the last month , to miss smith -- such attentions as i have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which i had not supposed possible ! believe me , sir , i am far , very far , from gratified in being the object of such professions .\" \" good heaven !\" cried mr . elton , \" what can be the meaning of this ?-- miss smith !-- i never thought of miss smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend . if she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and i am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- but , miss smith , indeed !-- oh ! miss woodhouse ! who can think of miss smith , when miss woodhouse is near ! no , upon my honour , there is no unsteadiness of character . i have thought only of you . i protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else . every thing that i have said or done , for many weeks past , has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself . you cannot really , seriously , doubt it . no !--( in an accent meant to be insinuating )-- i am sure you have seen and understood me .\" it would be impossible to say what emma felt , on hearing this -- which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost . she was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply : and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for mr . elton \\' s sanguine state of mind , he tried to take her hand again , as he joyously exclaimed -- \" charming miss woodhouse ! allow me to interpret this interesting silence . it confesses that you have long understood me .\" \" no , sir ,\" cried emma , \" it confesses no such thing . so far from having long understood you , i have been in a most complete error with respect to your views , till this moment . as to myself , i am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings -- nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend harriet -- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared ,) gave me great pleasure , and i have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had i supposed that she were not your attraction to hartfield , i should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent . am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to miss smith ?-- that you have never thought seriously of her ?\" \" never , madam ,\" cried he , affronted in his turn : \" never , i assure you . _i_ think seriously of miss smith !-- miss smith is a very good sort of girl ; and i should be happy to see her respectably settled . i wish her extremely well : and , no doubt , there are men who might not object to -- every body has their level : but as for myself , i am not , i think , quite so much at a loss . i need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , as to be addressing myself to miss smith !-- no , madam , my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only ; and the encouragement i received --\" \" encouragement !-- i give you encouragement !-- sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it . i have seen you only as the admirer of my friend . in no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance . i am exceedingly sorry : but it is well that the mistake ends where it does . had the same behaviour continued , miss smith might have been led into a misconception of your views ; not being aware , probably , any more than myself , of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of . but , as it is , the disappointment is single , and , i trust , will not be lasting . i have no thoughts of matrimony at present .\" he was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of mr . woodhouse had confined them to a foot - pace . if there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment . without knowing when the carriage turned into vicarage lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed .-- emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night . the compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to hartfield . there she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from vicarage lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of -- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no james ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for mr . john knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself .-- but her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection . chapter xvi the hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and emma sat down to think and be miserable .-- it was a wretched business indeed !-- such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for !-- such a development of every thing most unwelcome !-- such a blow for harriet !-- that was the worst of all . every part of it brought pain and humiliation , of some sort or other ; but , compared with the evil to harriet , all was light ; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken -- more in error -- more disgraced by mis - judgment , than she actually was , could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself . \" if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man , i could have borne any thing . he might have doubled his presumption to me -- but poor harriet !\" how she could have been so deceived !-- he protested that he had never thought seriously of harriet -- never ! she looked back as well as she could ; but it was all confusion . she had taken up the idea , she supposed , and made every thing bend to it . his manners , however , must have been unmarked , wavering , dubious , or she could not have been so misled . the picture !-- how eager he had been about the picture !-- and the charade !-- and an hundred other circumstances ;-- how clearly they had seemed to point at harriet . to be sure , the charade , with its \" ready wit \"-- but then the \" soft eyes \"-- in fact it suited neither ; it was a jumble without taste or truth . who could have seen through such thick - headed nonsense ? certainly she had often , especially of late , thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant ; but it had passed as his way , as a mere error of judgment , of knowledge , of taste , as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society , that with all the gentleness of his address , true elegance was sometimes wanting ; but , till this very day , she had never , for an instant , suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as harriet \\' s friend . to mr . john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility . there was no denying that those brothers had penetration . she remembered what mr . knightley had once said to her about mr . elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that mr . elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself . it was dreadfully mortifying ; but mr . elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others . contrary to the usual course of things , mr . elton \\' s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion . his professions and his proposals did him no service . she thought nothing of his attachment , and was insulted by his hopes . he wanted to marry well , and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her , pretended to be in love ; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for . there had been no real affection either in his language or manners . sighs and fine words had been given in abundance ; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions , or fancy any tone of voice , less allied with real love . she need not trouble herself to pity him . he only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself ; and if miss woodhouse of hartfield , the heiress of thirty thousand pounds , were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied , he would soon try for miss somebody else with twenty , or with ten . but -- that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ), to marry him !-- should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind !-- look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her !-- it was most provoking . perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind . the very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it ; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior . he must know that the woodhouses had been settled for several generations at hartfield , the younger branch of a very ancient family -- and that the eltons were nobody . the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable , being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate , to which all the rest of highbury belonged ; but their fortune , from other sources , was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself , in every other kind of consequence ; and the woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which mr . elton had first entered not two years ago , to make his way as he could , without any alliances but in trade , or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility .-- but he had fancied her in love with him ; that evidently must have been his dependence ; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head , emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging , so full of courtesy and attention , as ( supposing her real motive unperceived ) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy , like mr . elton , in fancying himself a very decided favourite . if _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that _he_ , with self - interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers . the first error and the worst lay at her door . it was foolish , it was wrong , to take so active a part in bringing any two people together . it was adventuring too far , assuming too much , making light of what ought to be serious , a trick of what ought to be simple . she was quite concerned and ashamed , and resolved to do such things no more . \" here have i ,\" said she , \" actually talked poor harriet into being very much attached to this man . she might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if i had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as i used to think him . oh ! that i had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young martin . there i was quite right . that was well done of me ; but there i should have stopped , and left the rest to time and chance . i was introducing her into good company , and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having ; i ought not to have attempted more . but now , poor girl , her peace is cut up for some time . i have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much , i am sure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her ;-- william coxe -- oh ! no , i could not endure william coxe -- a pert young lawyer .\" she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse , and then resumed a more serious , more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been , and might be , and must be . the distressing explanation she had to make to harriet , and all that poor harriet would be suffering , with the awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment , and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully . to youth and natural cheerfulness like emma \\' s , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits . the youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy , and of powerful operation ; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed , they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope . emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it . it was a great consolation that mr . elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that harriet \\' s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive -- and that there could be no necessity for any body \\' s knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father \\' s being given a moment \\' s uneasiness about it . these were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present . the weather was most favourable for her ; though christmas day , she could not go to church . mr . woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas . the ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner . no intercourse with harriet possible but by note ; no church for her on sunday any more than on christmas day ; and no need to find excuses for mr . elton \\' s absenting himself . it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to mr . knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them ,-- \" ah ! mr . knightley , why do not you stay at home like poor mr . elton ?\" these days of confinement would have been , but for her private perplexities , remarkably comfortable , as such seclusion exactly suited her brother , whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions ; and he had , besides , so thoroughly cleared off his ill - humour at randalls , that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at hartfield . he was always agreeable and obliging , and speaking pleasantly of every body . but with all the hopes of cheerfulness , and all the present comfort of delay , there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with harriet , as made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease . chapter xvii mr . and mrs . john knightley were not detained long at hartfield . the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move ; and mr . woodhouse having , as usual , tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children , was obliged to see the whole party set off , and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor isabella ;-- which poor isabella , passing her life with those she doated on , full of their merits , blind to their faults , and always innocently busy , might have been a model of right feminine happiness . the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from mr . elton to mr . woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with mr . elton \\' s best compliments , \" that he was proposing to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of mr . woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense -- and had mr . woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them .\" emma was most agreeably surprized .-- mr . elton \\' s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired . she admired him for contriving it , though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced . resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father , from which she was so pointedly excluded . she had not even a share in his opening compliments .-- her name was not mentioned ;-- and there was so striking a change in all this , and such an ill - judged solemnity of leave - taking in his graceful acknowledgments , as she thought , at first , could not escape her father \\' s suspicion . it did , however .-- her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that mr . elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language . it was a very useful note , for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening . mr . woodhouse talked over his alarms , and emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude . she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark . she had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman \\' s return . she went to mrs . goddard \\' s accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was .-- she had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding -- to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred -- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks . the confession completely renewed her first shame -- and the sight of harriet \\' s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again . harriet bore the intelligence very well -- blaming nobody -- and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself , as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend . emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on harriet \\' s side , not her own . harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of . the affection of such a man as mr . elton would have been too great a distinction .-- she never could have deserved him -- and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible . her tears fell abundantly -- but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emma \\' s eyes -- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding -- really for the time convinced that harriet was the superior creature of the two -- and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do . it was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life . her second duty now , inferior only to her father \\' s claims , was to promote harriet \\' s comfort , and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match - making . she got her to hartfield , and shewed her the most unvarying kindness , striving to occupy and amuse her , and by books and conversation , to drive mr . elton from her thoughts . time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr . elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriet \\' s age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of mr . elton \\' s return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them . harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness -- and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force . if mr . elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine harriet \\' s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him . their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , in the same place , was bad for each , for all three . not one of them had the power of removal , or of effecting any material change of society . they must encounter each other , and make the best of it . harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at mrs . goddard \\' s ; mr . elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth . where the wound had been given , there must the cure be found if anywhere ; and emma felt that , till she saw her in the way of cure , there could be no true peace for herself . chapter xviii mr . frank churchill did not come . when the time proposed drew near , mrs . weston \\' s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse . for the present , he could not be spared , to his \" very great mortification and regret ; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period .\" mrs . weston was exceedingly disappointed -- much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband , though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression . it soon flies over the present failure , and begins to hope again . for half an hour mr . weston was surprized and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that frank \\' s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan ; better time of year ; better weather ; and that he would be able , without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner . these feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while mrs . weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself . emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about mr . frank churchill \\' s not coming , except as a disappointment at randalls . the acquaintance at present had no charm for her . she wanted , rather , to be quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , as it was desirable that she should appear , in general , like her usual self , she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance , and enter as warmly into mr . and mrs . weston \\' s disappointment , as might naturally belong to their friendship . she was the first to announce it to mr . knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more ,) at the conduct of the churchills , in keeping him away . she then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt , of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry ; the pleasure of looking at somebody new ; the gala - day to highbury entire , which the sight of him would have made ; and ending with reflections on the churchills again , found herself directly involved in a disagreement with mr . knightley ; and , to her great amusement , perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion , and making use of mrs . weston \\' s arguments against herself . \" the churchills are very likely in fault ,\" said mr . knightley , coolly ; \" but i dare say he might come if he would .\" \" i do not know why you should say so . he wishes exceedingly to come ; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him .\" \" i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming , if he made a point of it . it is too unlikely , for me to believe it without proof .\" \" how odd you are ! what has mr . frank churchill done , to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature ?\" \" i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature , in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions , and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure , from living with those who have always set him the example of it . it is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too . if frank churchill had wanted to see his father , he would have contrived it between september and january . a man at his age -- what is he ?-- three or four - and - twenty -- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that . it is impossible .\" \" that \\' s easily said , and easily felt by you , who have always been your own master . you are the worst judge in the world , mr . knightley , of the difficulties of dependence . you do not know what it is to have tempers to manage .\" \" it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four - and - twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount . he cannot want money -- he cannot want leisure . we know , on the contrary , that he has so much of both , that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom . we hear of him for ever at some watering - place or other . a little while ago , he was at weymouth . this proves that he can leave the churchills .\" \" yes , sometimes he can .\" \" and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while ; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure .\" \" it is very unfair to judge of any body \\' s conduct , without an intimate knowledge of their situation . nobody , who has not been in the interior of a family , can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be . we ought to be acquainted with enscombe , and with mrs . churchill \\' s temper , before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do . he may , at times , be able to do a great deal more than he can at others .\" \" there is one thing , emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution . it is frank churchill \\' s duty to pay this attention to his father . he knows it to be so , by his promises and messages ; but if he wished to do it , it might be done . a man who felt rightly would say at once , simply and resolutely , to mrs . churchill -- ` every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience ; but i must go and see my father immediately . i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion . i shall , therefore , set off to - morrow .\\'-- if he would say so to her at once , in the tone of decision becoming a man , there would be no opposition made to his going .\" \" no ,\" said emma , laughing ; \" but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again . such language for a young man entirely dependent , to use !-- nobody but you , mr . knightley , would imagine it possible . but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own . mr . frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him !-- standing up in the middle of the room , i suppose , and speaking as loud as he could !-- how can you imagine such conduct practicable ?\" \" depend upon it , emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it . he would feel himself in the right ; and the declaration -- made , of course , as a man of sense would make it , in a proper manner -- would do him more good , raise him higher , fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on , than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do . respect would be added to affection . they would feel that they could trust him ; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father , would do rightly by them ; for they know , as well as he does , as well as all the world must know , that he ought to pay this visit to his father ; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it , are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims . respect for right conduct is felt by every body . if he would act in this sort of manner , on principle , consistently , regularly , their little minds would bend to his .\" \" i rather doubt that . you are very fond of bending little minds ; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority , i think they have a knack of swelling out , till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones . i can imagine , that if you , as you are , mr . knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in mr . frank churchill \\' s situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect . the churchills might not have a word to say in return ; but then , you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through . to him who has , it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence , and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought . he may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it .\" \" then it would not be so strong a sense . if it failed to produce equal exertion , it could not be an equal conviction .\" \" oh , the difference of situation and habit ! i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those , whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life .\" \" our amiable young man is a very weak young man , if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others . it ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency . i can allow for the fears of the child , but not of the man . as he became rational , he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority . he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father . had he begun as he ought , there would have been no difficulty now .\" \" we shall never agree about him ,\" cried emma ; \" but that is nothing extraordinary . i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man : i feel sure that he is not . mr . weston would not be blind to folly , though in his own son ; but he is very likely to have a more yielding , complying , mild disposition than would suit your notions of man \\' s perfection . i dare say he has ; and though it may cut him off from some advantages , it will secure him many others .\" \" yes ; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move , and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure , and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it . he can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter , full of professions and falsehoods , and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father \\' s having any right to complain . his letters disgust me .\" \" your feelings are singular . they seem to satisfy every body else .\" \" i suspect they do not satisfy mrs . weston . they hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings : standing in a mother \\' s place , but without a mother \\' s affection to blind her . it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due , and she must doubly feel the omission . had she been a person of consequence herself , he would have come i dare say ; and it would not have signified whether he did or no . can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations ? do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself ? no , emma , your amiable young man can be amiable only in french , not in english . he may be very ` aimable ,\\' have very good manners , and be very agreeable ; but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people : nothing really amiable about him .\" \" you seem determined to think ill of him .\" \" me !-- not at all ,\" replied mr . knightley , rather displeased ; \" i do not want to think ill of him . i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but i hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well - grown and good - looking , with smooth , plausible manners .\" \" well , if he have nothing else to recommend him , he will be a treasure at highbury . we do not often look upon fine young men , well - bred and agreeable . we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain . cannot you imagine , mr . knightley , what a _sensation_ his coming will produce ? there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury ; but one interest -- one object of curiosity ; it will be all mr . frank churchill ; we shall think and speak of nobody else .\" \" you will excuse my being so much over - powered . if i find him conversable , i shall be glad of his acquaintance ; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb , he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts .\" \" my idea of him is , that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body , and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable . to you , he will talk of farming ; to me , of drawing or music ; and so on to every body , having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead , or take the lead , just as propriety may require , and to speak extremely well on each ; that is my idea of him .\" \" and mine ,\" said mr . knightley warmly , \" is , that if he turn out any thing like it , he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing ! what ! at three - and - twenty to be the king of his company -- the great man -- the practised politician , who is to read every body \\' s character , and make every body \\' s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority ; to be dispensing his flatteries around , that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself ! my dear emma , your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point .\" \" i will say no more about him ,\" cried emma , \" you turn every thing to evil . we are both prejudiced ; you against , i for him ; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here .\" \" prejudiced ! i am not prejudiced .\" \" but i am very much , and without being at all ashamed of it . my love for mr . and mrs . weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour .\" \" he is a person i never think of from one month \\' s end to another ,\" said mr . knightley , with a degree of vexation , which made emma immediately talk of something else , though she could not comprehend why he should be angry . to take a dislike to a young man , only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself , was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him ; for with all the high opinion of himself , which she had often laid to his charge , she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another . volume ii chapter i emma and harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in emma \\' s opinion , had been talking enough of mr . elton for that day . she could not think that harriet \\' s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned ;-- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive -- \" mr . elton is so good to the poor !\" she found something else must be done . they were just approaching the house where lived mrs . and miss bates . she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers . there was always sufficient reason for such an attention ; mrs . and miss bates loved to be called on , and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her , as rather negligent in that respect , and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts . she had had many a hint from mr . knightley and some from her own heart , as to her deficiency -- but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable ,-- a waste of time -- tiresome women -- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second - rate and third - rate of highbury , who were calling on them for ever , and therefore she seldom went near them . but now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in -- observing , as she proposed it to harriet , that , as well as she could calculate , they were just now quite safe from any letter from jane fairfax . the house belonged to people in business . mrs . and miss bates occupied the drawing - room floor ; and there , in the very moderate - sized apartment , which was every thing to them , the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed ; the quiet neat old lady , who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner , wanting even to give up her place to miss woodhouse , and her more active , talking daughter , almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness , thanks for their visit , solicitude for their shoes , anxious inquiries after mr . woodhouse \\' s health , cheerful communications about her mother \\' s , and sweet - cake from the beaufet --\" mrs . cole had just been there , just called in for ten minutes , and had been so good as to sit an hour with them , and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much ; and , therefore , she hoped miss woodhouse and miss smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too .\" the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr . elton . there was intimacy between them , and mr . cole had heard from mr . elton since his going away . emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone , and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went , and how full the master of the ceremonies \\' ball had been ; and she went through it very well , with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , and always putting forward to prevent harriet \\' s being obliged to say a word . this she had been prepared for when she entered the house ; but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander at large amongst all the mistresses and misses of highbury , and their card - parties . she had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr . elton ; but he was actually hurried off by miss bates , she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the coles , to usher in a letter from her niece . \" oh ! yes -- mr . elton , i understand -- certainly as to dancing -- mrs . cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was -- mrs . cole was so kind as to sit some time with us , talking of jane ; for as soon as she came in , she began inquiring after her , jane is so very great a favourite there . whenever she is with us , mrs . cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can . and so she began inquiring after her directly , saying , ` i know you cannot have heard from jane lately , because it is not her time for writing ;\\' and when i immediately said , ` but indeed we have , we had a letter this very morning ,\\' i do not know that i ever saw any body more surprized . ` have you , upon your honour ?\\' said she ; ` well , that is quite unexpected . do let me hear what she says .\\'\" emma \\' s politeness was at hand directly , to say , with smiling interest -- \" have you heard from miss fairfax so lately ? i am extremely happy . i hope she is well ?\" \" thank you . you are so kind !\" replied the happily deceived aunt , while eagerly hunting for the letter .--\" oh ! here it is . i was sure it could not be far off ; but i had put my huswife upon it , you see , without being aware , and so it was quite hid , but i had it in my hand so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table . i was reading it to mrs . cole , and since she went away , i was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her -- a letter from jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so i knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says ;-- but , first of all , i really must , in justice to jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half . my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well . she often says , when the letter is first opened , ` well , hetty , now i think you will be put to it to make out all that checker - work \\'-- don \\' t you , ma \\' am ?-- and then i tell her , i am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her -- every word of it -- i am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word . and , indeed , though my mother \\' s eyes are not so good as they were , she can see amazingly well still , thank god ! with the help of spectacles . it is such a blessing ! my mother \\' s are really very good indeed . jane often says , when she is here , ` i am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too !-- i only wish my eyes may last me as well .\\'\" all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath ; and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss fairfax \\' s handwriting . \" you are extremely kind ,\" replied miss bates , highly gratified ; \" you who are such a judge , and write so beautifully yourself . i am sure there is nobody \\' s praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouse \\' s . my mother does not hear ; she is a little deaf you know . ma \\' am ,\" addressing her , \" do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about jane \\' s handwriting ?\" and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it . she was pondering , in the meanwhile , upon the possibility , without seeming very rude , of making her escape from jane fairfax \\' s letter , and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse , when miss bates turned to her again and seized her attention . \" my mother \\' s deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all . by only raising my voice , and saying any thing two or three times over , she is sure to hear ; but then she is used to my voice . but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me . jane speaks so distinct ! however , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother \\' s time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here . we never were so long without seeing her before , and as i was telling mrs . cole , we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now .\" \" are you expecting miss fairfax here soon ?\" \" oh yes ; next week .\" \" indeed !-- that must be a very great pleasure .\" \" thank you . you are very kind . yes , next week . every body is so surprized ; and every body says the same obliging things . i am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury , as they can be to see her . yes , friday or saturday ; she cannot say which , because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days . so very good of them to send her the whole way ! but they always do , you know . oh yes , friday or saturday next . that is what she writes about . that is the reason of her writing out of rule , as we call it ; for , in the common course , we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday .\" \" yes , so i imagined . i was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to - day .\" \" so obliging of you ! no , we should not have heard , if it had not been for this particular circumstance , of her being to come here so soon . my mother is so delighted !-- for she is to be three months with us at least . three months , she says so , positively , as i am going to have the pleasure of reading to you . the case is , you see , that the campbells are going to ireland . mrs . dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly . they had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last october , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , i was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , i declare i do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in jane \\' s letter -- wrote in mr . dixon \\' s name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly , and they would give them the meeting in dublin , and take them back to their country seat , baly - craig , a beautiful place , i fancy . jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from mr . dixon , i mean -- i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for colonel and mrs . campbell were very particular about their daughter \\' s not walking out often with only mr . dixon , for which i do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell about his own home in ireland ; and i think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself . he is a most amiable , charming young man , i believe . jane was quite longing to go to ireland , from his account of things .\" at this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emma \\' s brain with regard to jane fairfax , this charming mr . dixon , and the not going to ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery , \" you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time . considering the very particular friendship between her and mrs . dixon , you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs . campbell .\" \" very true , very true , indeed . the very thing that we have always been rather afraid of ; for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us , for months together -- not able to come if any thing was to happen . but you see , every thing turns out for the best . they want her ( mr . and mrs . dixon ) excessively to come over with colonel and mrs . campbell ; quite depend upon it ; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _joint_ invitation , jane says , as you will hear presently ; mr . dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention . he is a most charming young man . ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit -- ( i can never think of it without trembling !)-- but ever since we had the history of that day , i have been so fond of mr . dixon !\" \" but , in spite of all her friends \\' urgency , and her own wish of seeing ireland , miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and mrs . bates ?\" \" yes -- entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and colonel and mrs . campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately .\" \" i am concerned to hear of it . i think they judge wisely . but mrs . dixon must be very much disappointed . mrs . dixon , i understand , has no remarkable degree of personal beauty ; is not , by any means , to be compared with miss fairfax .\" \" oh ! no . you are very obliging to say such things -- but certainly not . there is no comparison between them . miss campbell always was absolutely plain -- but extremely elegant and amiable .\" \" yes , that of course .\" \" jane caught a bad cold , poor thing ! so long ago as the 7th of november , ( as i am going to read to you ,) and has never been well since . a long time , is not it , for a cold to hang upon her ? she never mentioned it before , because she would not alarm us . just like her ! so considerate !-- but however , she is so far from well , that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home , and try an air that always agrees with her ; and they have no doubt that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her -- and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here , than go to ireland , if she is unwell . nobody could nurse her , as we should do .\" \" it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world .\" \" and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday , and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following -- as you will find from jane \\' s letter . so sudden !-- you may guess , dear miss woodhouse , what a flurry it has thrown me in ! if it was not for the drawback of her illness -- but i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin , and looking very poorly . i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me , as to that . i always make a point of reading jane \\' s letters through to myself first , before i read them aloud to my mother , you know , for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her . jane desired me to do it , so i always do : and so i began to - day with my usual caution ; but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell , than i burst out , quite frightened , with ` bless me ! poor jane is ill !\\'-- which my mother , being on the watch , heard distinctly , and was sadly alarmed at . however , when i read on , i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first ; and i make so light of it now to her , that she does not think much about it . but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my guard . if jane does not get well soon , we will call in mr . perry . the expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know . he has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time . well , now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her .\" \" i am afraid we must be running away ,\" said emma , glancing at harriet , and beginning to rise --\" my father will be expecting us . i had no intention , i thought i had no power of staying more than five minutes , when i first entered the house . i merely called , because i would not pass the door without inquiring after mrs . bates ; but i have been so pleasantly detained ! now , however , we must wish you and mrs . bates good morning .\" and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded . she regained the street -- happy in this , that though much had been forced on her against her will , though she had in fact heard the whole substance of jane fairfax \\' s letter , she had been able to escape the letter itself . chapter ii jane fairfax was an orphan , the only child of mrs . bates \\' s youngest daughter . the marriage of lieut . fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry , and miss jane bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards -- and this girl . by birth she belonged to highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the fondling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm - hearted , well - meaning relations . but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny . this was colonel campbell , who had very highly regarded fairfax , as an excellent officer and most deserving young man ; and farther , had been indebted to him for such attentions , during a severe camp - fever , as he believed had saved his life . these were claims which he did not learn to overlook , though some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax , before his own return to england put any thing in his power . when he did return , he sought out the child and took notice of her . he was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about jane \\' s age : and jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter \\' s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education . it was accepted ; and from that period jane had belonged to colonel campbell \\' s family , and had lived with them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to time . the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible . to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel campbell \\' s power ; for though his income , by pay and appointments , was handsome , his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter \\' s ; but , by giving her an education , he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter . such was jane fairfax \\' s history . she had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the campbells , and been given an excellent education . living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and colonel campbell \\' s residence being in london , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first - rate masters . her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with . neither father nor mother could promote , and the daughter could not endure it . the evil day was put off . it was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over . the affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of miss campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of jane \\' s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements . that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents . they continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of miss campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of mr . dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn . this event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning . she had long resolved that one - and - twenty should be the period . with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she had resolved at one - and - twenty to complete the sacrifice , and retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to penance and mortification for ever . the good sense of colonel and mrs . campbell could not oppose such a resolution , though their feelings did . as long as they lived , no exertions would be necessary , their home might be hers for ever ; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly ; but this would be selfishness :-- what must be at last , had better be soon . perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay , and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished . still , however , affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment . she had never been quite well since the time of their daughter \\' s marriage ; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength , they must forbid her engaging in duties , which , so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits , seemed , under the most favourable circumstances , to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort . with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth , though there might be some truths not told . it was her own choice to give the time of their absence to highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else . certain it was that she was to come ; and that highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- mr . frank churchill -- must put up for the present with jane fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years \\' absence . emma was sorry ;-- to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months !-- to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought ! why she did not like jane fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; mr . knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her . but \" she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve -- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker !-- and she was made such a fuss with by every body !-- and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other .\" these were her reasons -- she had no better . it was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years \\' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating . jane fairfax was very elegant , remarkably elegant ; and she had herself the highest value for elegance . her height was pretty , just such as almost every body would think tall , and nobody could think very tall ; her figure particularly graceful ; her size a most becoming medium , between fat and thin , though a slight appearance of ill - health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two . emma could not but feel all this ; and then , her face -- her features -- there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered ; it was not regular , but it was very pleasing beauty . her eyes , a deep grey , with dark eye - lashes and eyebrows , had never been denied their praise ; but the skin , which she had been used to cavil at , as wanting colour , had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom . it was a style of beauty , of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her principles , admire it :-- elegance , which , whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in highbury . there , not to be vulgar , was distinction , and merit . in short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at jane fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer . when she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to mr . dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself . in that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on . emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced mr . dixon \\' s actions from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first . if it were love , it might be simple , single , successless love on her side alone . she might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty . upon the whole , emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her . these were charming feelings -- but not lasting . before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for jane fairfax , or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors , than saying to mr . knightley , \" she certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome !\" jane had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state . former provocations reappeared . the aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and jane \\' s offences rose again . they had music ; emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance . she was , besides , which was the worst of all , so cold , so cautious ! there was no getting at her real opinion . wrapt up in a cloak of politeness , she seemed determined to hazard nothing . she was disgustingly , was suspiciously reserved . if any thing could be more , where all was most , she was more reserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing . she seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr . dixon \\' s character , or her own value for his company , or opinion of the suitableness of the match . it was all general approbation and smoothness ; nothing delineated or distinguished . it did her no service however . her caution was thrown away . emma saw its artifice , and returned to her first surmises . there probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference ; mr . dixon , perhaps , had been very near changing one friend for the other , or been fixed only to miss campbell , for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds . the like reserve prevailed on other topics . she and mr . frank churchill had been at weymouth at the same time . it was known that they were a little acquainted ; but not a syllable of real information could emma procure as to what he truly was . \" was he handsome ?\"--\" she believed he was reckoned a very fine young man .\" \" was he agreeable ?\"-- \" he was generally thought so .\" \" did he appear a sensible young man ; a young man of information ?\"--\" at a watering - place , or in a common london acquaintance , it was difficult to decide on such points . manners were all that could be safely judged of , under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of mr . churchill . she believed every body found his manners pleasing .\" emma could not forgive her . chapter iii emma could not forgive her ;-- but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by mr . knightley , who had been of the party , and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side , he was expressing the next morning , being at hartfield again on business with mr . woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma . he had been used to think her unjust to jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement . \" a very pleasant evening ,\" he began , as soon as mr . woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary , told that he understood , and the papers swept away ;--\" particularly pleasant . you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music . i do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one \\' s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation . i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , emma . you left nothing undone . i was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother \\' s , it must have been a real indulgence .\" \" i am happy you approved ,\" said emma , smiling ; \" but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield .\" \" no , my dear ,\" said her father instantly ; \" _that_ i am sure you are not . there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are . if any thing , you are too attentive . the muffin last night -- if it had been handed round once , i think it would have been enough .\" \" no ,\" said mr . knightley , nearly at the same time ; \" you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension . i think you understand me , therefore .\" an arch look expressed --\" i understand you well enough ;\" but she said only , \" miss fairfax is reserved .\" \" i always told you she was -- a little ; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome , all that has its foundation in diffidence . what arises from discretion must be honoured .\" \" you think her diffident . i do not see it .\" \" my dear emma ,\" said he , moving from his chair into one close by her , \" you are not going to tell me , i hope , that you had not a pleasant evening .\" \" oh ! no ; i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions ; and amused to think how little information i obtained .\" \" i am disappointed ,\" was his only answer . \" i hope every body had a pleasant evening ,\" said mr . woodhouse , in his quiet way . \" i had . once , i felt the fire rather too much ; but then i moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me . miss bates was very chatty and good - humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick . however , she is very agreeable , and mrs . bates too , in a different way . i like old friends ; and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed . she must have found the evening agreeable , mr . knightley , because she had emma .\" \" true , sir ; and emma , because she had miss fairfax .\" emma saw his anxiety , and wishing to appease it , at least for the present , said , and with a sincerity which no one could question -- \" she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one \\' s eyes from . i am always watching her to admire ; and i do pity her from my heart .\" mr . knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express ; and before he could make any reply , mr . woodhouse , whose thoughts were on the bates \\' s , said -- \" it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined ! a great pity indeed ! and i have often wished -- but it is so little one can venture to do -- small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon -- now we have killed a porker , and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate -- hartfield pork is not like any other pork -- but still it is pork -- and , my dear emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork -- i think we had better send the leg -- do not you think so , my dear ?\" \" my dear papa , i sent the whole hind - quarter . i knew you would wish it . there will be the leg to be salted , you know , which is so very nice , and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like .\" \" that \\' s right , my dear , very right . i had not thought of it before , but that is the best way . they must not over - salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , i do not consider it unwholesome .\" \" emma ,\" said mr . knightley presently , \" i have a piece of news for you . you like news -- and i heard an article in my way hither that i think will interest you .\" \" news ! oh ! yes , i always like news . what is it ?-- why do you smile so ?-- where did you hear it ?-- at randalls ?\" he had time only to say , \" no , not at randalls ; i have not been near randalls ,\" when the door was thrown open , and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room . full of thanks , and full of news , miss bates knew not which to give quickest . mr . knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment , and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him . \" oh ! my dear sir , how are you this morning ? my dear miss woodhouse -- i come quite over - powered . such a beautiful hind - quarter of pork ! you are too bountiful ! have you heard the news ? mr . elton is going to be married .\" emma had not had time even to think of mr . elton , and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start , and a little blush , at the sound . \" there is my news :-- i thought it would interest you ,\" said mr . knightley , with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them . \" but where could _you_ hear it ?\" cried miss bates . \" where could you possibly hear it , mr . knightley ? for it is not five minutes since i received mrs . cole \\' s note -- no , it cannot be more than five -- or at least ten -- for i had got my bonnet and spencer on , just ready to come out -- i was only gone down to speak to patty again about the pork -- jane was standing in the passage -- were not you , jane ?-- for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting - pan large enough . so i said i would go down and see , and jane said , ` shall i go down instead ? for i think you have a little cold , and patty has been washing the kitchen .\\'--` oh ! my dear ,\\' said i -- well , and just then came the note . a miss hawkins -- that \\' s all i know . a miss hawkins of bath . but , mr . knightley , how could you possibly have heard it ? for the very moment mr . cole told mrs . cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me . a miss hawkins --\" \" i was with mr . cole on business an hour and a half ago . he had just read elton \\' s letter as i was shewn in , and handed it to me directly .\" \" well ! that is quite -- i suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting . my dear sir , you really are too bountiful . my mother desires her very best compliments and regards , and a thousand thanks , and says you really quite oppress her .\" \" we consider our hartfield pork ,\" replied mr . woodhouse --\" indeed it certainly is , so very superior to all other pork , that emma and i cannot have a greater pleasure than --\" \" oh ! my dear sir , as my mother says , our friends are only too good to us . if ever there were people who , without having great wealth themselves , had every thing they could wish for , i am sure it is us . we may well say that ` our lot is cast in a goodly heritage .\\' well , mr . knightley , and so you actually saw the letter ; well --\" \" it was short -- merely to announce -- but cheerful , exulting , of course .\"-- here was a sly glance at emma . \" he had been so fortunate as to -- i forget the precise words -- one has no business to remember them . the information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins . by his style , i should imagine it just settled .\" \" mr . elton going to be married !\" said emma , as soon as she could speak . \" he will have every body \\' s wishes for his happiness .\" \" he is very young to settle ,\" was mr . woodhouse \\' s observation . \" he had better not be in a hurry . he seemed to me very well off as he was . we were always glad to see him at hartfield .\" \" a new neighbour for us all , miss woodhouse !\" said miss bates , joyfully ; \" my mother is so pleased !-- she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress . this is great news , indeed . jane , you have never seen mr . elton !-- no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him .\" jane \\' s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her . \" no -- i have never seen mr . elton ,\" she replied , starting on this appeal ; \" is he -- is he a tall man ?\" \" who shall answer that question ?\" cried emma . \" my father would say ` yes ,\\' mr . knightley ` no ;\\' and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium . when you have been here a little longer , miss fairfax , you will understand that mr . elton is the standard of perfection in highbury , both in person and mind .\" \" very true , miss woodhouse , so she will . he is the very best young man -- but , my dear jane , if you remember , i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr . perry . miss hawkins ,-- i dare say , an excellent young woman . his extreme attention to my mother -- wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know -- it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick . jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf . he fancied bathing might be good for it -- the warm bath -- but she says it did him no lasting benefit . colonel campbell , you know , is quite our angel . and mr . dixon seems a very charming young man , quite worthy of him . it is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do . now , here will be mr . elton and miss hawkins ; and there are the coles , such very good people ; and the perrys -- i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr . and mrs . perry . i say , sir ,\" turning to mr . woodhouse , \" i think there are few places with such society as highbury . i always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours .-- my dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork -- a roast loin of pork --\" \" as to who , or what miss hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her ,\" said emma , \" nothing i suppose can be known . one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance . he has been gone only four weeks .\" nobody had any information to give ; and , after a few more wonderings , emma said , \" you are silent , miss fairfax -- but i hope you mean to take an interest in this news . you , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on miss campbell \\' s account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about mr . elton and miss hawkins .\" \" when i have seen mr . elton ,\" replied jane , \" i dare say i shall be interested -- but i believe it requires _that_ with me . and as it is some months since miss campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off .\" \" yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , miss woodhouse ,\" said miss bates , \" four weeks yesterday .-- a miss hawkins !-- well , i had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that i ever -- mrs . cole once whispered to me -- but i immediately said , ` no , mr . elton is a most worthy young man -- but \\'-- in short , i do not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries . i do not pretend to it . what is before me , i see . at the same time , nobody could wonder if mr . elton should have aspired -- miss woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good - humouredly . she knows i would not offend for the world . how does miss smith do ? she seems quite recovered now . have you heard from mrs . john knightley lately ? oh ! those dear little children . jane , do you know i always fancy mr . dixon like mr . john knightley . i mean in person -- tall , and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative .\" \" quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all .\" \" very odd ! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand . one takes up a notion , and runs away with it . mr . dixon , you say , is not , strictly speaking , handsome ?\" \" handsome ! oh ! no -- far from it -- certainly plain . i told you he was plain .\" \" my dear , you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself --\" \" oh ! as for me , my judgment is worth nothing . where i have a regard , i always think a person well - looking . but i gave what i believed the general opinion , when i called him plain .\" \" well , my dear jane , i believe we must be running away . the weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy . you are too obliging , my dear miss woodhouse ; but we really must take leave . this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed . i shall just go round by mrs . cole \\' s ; but i shall not stop three minutes : and , jane , you had better go home directly -- i would not have you out in a shower !-- we think she is the better for highbury already . thank you , we do indeed . i shall not attempt calling on mrs . goddard , for i really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing . good morning to you , my dear sir . oh ! mr . knightley is coming too . well , that is so very !-- i am sure if jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm .-- mr . elton , and miss hawkins !-- good morning to you .\" emma , alone with her father , had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry -- and to marry strangers too -- and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject . it was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news , as proving that mr . elton could not have suffered long ; but she was sorry for harriet : harriet must feel it -- and all that she could hope was , by giving the first information herself , to save her from hearing it abruptly from others . it was now about the time that she was likely to call . if she were to meet miss bates in her way !-- and upon its beginning to rain , emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at mrs . goddard \\' s , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation . the shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the \" oh ! miss woodhouse , what do you think has happened !\" which instantly burst forth , had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation . as the blow was given , emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening ; and harriet , unchecked , ran eagerly through what she had to tell . \" she had set out from mrs . goddard \\' s half an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at ford \\' s .\"-- ford \\' s was the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper , and haberdasher \\' s shop united ; the shop first in size and fashion in the place .--\" and so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps -- when , all of a sudden , who should come in -- to be sure it was so very odd !-- but they always dealt at ford \\' s -- who should come in , but elizabeth martin and her brother !-- dear miss woodhouse ! only think . i thought i should have fainted . i did not know what to do . i was sitting near the door -- elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella . i am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ; and i kept sitting near the door !-- oh ! dear ; i was so miserable ! i am sure i must have been as white as my gown . i could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but i did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there .-- oh ! dear , miss woodhouse -- well , at last , i fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another . i am sure they were talking of me ; and i could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me --( do you think he was , miss woodhouse ?)-- for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me , and asked me how i did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if i would . she did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; i could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _try_ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but i know no more what i said -- i was in such a tremble !-- i remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which i thought almost too kind ! dear , miss woodhouse , i was absolutely miserable ! by that time , it was beginning to hold up , and i was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away -- and then -- only think !-- i found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and i answered -- and i stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one can \\' t tell how ; and then i took courage , and said it did not rain , and i must go ; and so off i set ; and i had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if i was going to hartfield , he thought i had much better go round by mr . cole \\' s stables , for i should find the near way quite floated by this rain . oh ! dear , i thought it would have been the death of me ! so i said , i was very much obliged to him : you know i could not do less ; and then he went back to elizabeth , and i came round by the stables -- i believe i did -- but i hardly knew where i was , or any thing about it . oh ! miss woodhouse , i would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly . and elizabeth , too . oh ! miss woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again .\" very sincerely did emma wish to do so ; but it was not immediately in her power . she was obliged to stop and think . she was not thoroughly comfortable herself . the young man \\' s conduct , and his sister \\' s , seemed the result of real feeling , and she could not but pity them . as harriet described it , there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour . but she had believed them to be well - meaning , worthy people before ; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion ? it was folly to be disturbed by it . of course , he must be sorry to lose her -- they must be all sorry . ambition , as well as love , had probably been mortified . they might all have hoped to rise by harriet \\' s acquaintance : and besides , what was the value of harriet \\' s description ?-- so easily pleased -- so little discerning ;-- what signified her praise ? she exerted herself , and did try to make her comfortable , by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle , and quite unworthy of being dwelt on , \" it might be distressing , for the moment ,\" said she ; \" but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over -- and may never -- can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it .\" harriet said , \" very true ,\" and she \" would not think about it ;\" but still she talked of it -- still she could talk of nothing else ; and emma , at last , in order to put the martins out of her head , was obliged to hurry on the news , which she had meant to give with so much tender caution ; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry , ashamed or only amused , at such a state of mind in poor harriet -- such a conclusion of mr . elton \\' s importance with her ! mr . elton \\' s rights , however , gradually revived . though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before , or an hour before , its interest soon increased ; and before their first conversation was over , she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity , wonder and regret , pain and pleasure , as to this fortunate miss hawkins , which could conduce to place the martins under proper subordination in her fancy . emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting . it had been serviceable in deadening the first shock , without retaining any influence to alarm . as harriet now lived , the martins could not get at her , without seeking her , where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her ; for since her refusal of the brother , the sisters never had been at mrs . goddard \\' s ; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again , with any necessity , or even any power of speech . chapter iv human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations , that a young person , who either marries or dies , is sure of being kindly spoken of . a week had not passed since miss hawkins \\' s name was first mentioned in highbury , before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when mr . elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate the fame of her merits , there was very little more for him to do , than to tell her christian name , and say whose music she principally played . mr . elton returned , a very happy man . he had gone away rejected and mortified -- disappointed in a very sanguine hope , after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement ; and not only losing the right lady , but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one . he had gone away deeply offended -- he came back engaged to another -- and to another as superior , of course , to the first , as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost . he came back gay and self - satisfied , eager and busy , caring nothing for miss woodhouse , and defying miss smith . the charming augusta hawkins , in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit , was in possession of an independent fortune , of so many thousands as would always be called ten ; a point of some dignity , as well as some convenience : the story told well ; he had not thrown himself away -- he had gained a woman of 10 , 000 l . or thereabouts ; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity -- the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice ; the history which he had to give mrs . cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious -- the steps so quick , from the accidental rencontre , to the dinner at mr . green \\' s , and the party at mrs . brown \\' s -- smiles and blushes rising in importance -- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered -- the lady had been so easily impressed -- so sweetly disposed -- had in short , to use a most intelligible phrase , been so very ready to have him , that vanity and prudence were equally contented . he had caught both substance and shadow -- both fortune and affection , and was just the happy man he ought to be ; talking only of himself and his own concerns -- expecting to be congratulated -- ready to be laughed at -- and , with cordial , fearless smiles , now addressing all the young ladies of the place , to whom , a few weeks ago , he would have been more cautiously gallant . the wedding was no distant event , as the parties had only themselves to please , and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for ; and when he set out for bath again , there was a general expectation , which a certain glance of mrs . cole \\' s did not seem to contradict , that when he next entered highbury he would bring his bride . during his present short stay , emma had barely seen him ; but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over , and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension , now spread over his air . she was , in fact , beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a moral light , as a penance , a lesson , a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again . she wished him very well ; but he gave her pain , and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction . the pain of his continued residence in highbury , however , must certainly be lessened by his marriage . many vain solicitudes would be prevented -- many awkwardnesses smoothed by it . a _mrs . _ _elton_ would be an excuse for any change of intercourse ; former intimacy might sink without remark . it would be almost beginning their life of civility again . of the lady , individually , emma thought very little . she was good enough for mr . elton , no doubt ; accomplished enough for highbury -- handsome enough -- to look plain , probably , by harriet \\' s side . as to connexion , there emma was perfectly easy ; persuaded , that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet , he had done nothing . on that article , truth seemed attainable . _what_ she was , must be uncertain ; but _who_ she was , might be found out ; and setting aside the 10 , 000 l ., it did not appear that she was at all harriet \\' s superior . she brought no name , no blood , no alliance . miss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a bristol -- merchant , of course , he must be called ; but , as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate , it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also . part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath ; but bristol was her home , the very heart of bristol ; for though the father and mother had died some years ago , an uncle remained -- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him , than that he was in the law line ; and with him the daughter had lived . emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney , and too stupid to rise . and all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister , who was _very_ _well_ _married_ , to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_ , near bristol , who kept two carriages ! that was the wind - up of the history ; that was the glory of miss hawkins . could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all ! she had talked her into love ; but , alas ! she was not so easily to be talked out of it . the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harriet \\' s mind was not to be talked away . he might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a robert martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her . harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love . and now , poor girl ! she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr . elton . she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other . emma saw him only once ; but two or three times every day harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him , or _just_ to miss him , _just_ to hear his voice , or see his shoulder , _just_ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy , in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture . she was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in mr . elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her . her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss hawkins \\' s happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached !-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love ! had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , in the waverings of harriet \\' s mind , emma would have been amused by its variations . sometimes mr . elton predominated , sometimes the martins ; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other . mr . elton \\' s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr . martin . the unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by elizabeth martin \\' s calling at mrs . goddard \\' s a few days afterwards . harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; and till mr . elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess . but mr . elton , in person , had driven away all such cares . while he staid , the martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for bath again , emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return elizabeth martin \\' s visit . how that visit was to be acknowledged -- what would be necessary -- and what might be safest , had been a point of some doubtful consideration . absolute neglect of the mother and sisters , when invited to come , would be ingratitude . it must not be : and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance !-- after much thinking , she could determine on nothing better , than harriet \\' s returning the visit ; but in a way that , if they had understanding , should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance . she meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the abbey mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future . she could think of nothing better : and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve -- something of ingratitude , merely glossed over -- it must be done , or what would become of harriet ? chapter v small heart had harriet for visiting . only half an hour before her friend called for her at mrs . goddard \\' s , her evil stars had led her to the very spot where , at that moment , a trunk , directed to _the_ _rev . _ _philip_ _elton_ , _white - hart_ , _bath_ , was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher \\' s cart , which was to convey it to where the coaches past ; and every thing in this world , excepting that trunk and the direction , was consequently a blank . she went , however ; and when they reached the farm , and she was to be put down , at the end of the broad , neat gravel walk , which led between espalier apple - trees to the front door , the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before , was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and when they parted , emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour . she went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in donwell . the quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again ; and miss smith receiving her summons , was with her without delay , and unattended by any alarming young man . she came solitarily down the gravel walk -- a miss martin just appearing at the door , and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility . harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account . she was feeling too much ; but at last emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting , and the sort of pain it was creating . she had seen only mrs . martin and the two girls . they had received her doubtingly , if not coolly ; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time -- till just at last , when mrs . martin \\' s saying , all of a sudden , that she thought miss smith was grown , had brought on a more interesting subject , and a warmer manner . in that very room she had been measured last september , with her two friends . there were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window . _he_ had done it . they all seemed to remember the day , the hour , the party , the occasion -- to feel the same consciousness , the same regrets -- to be ready to return to the same good understanding ; and they were just growing again like themselves , ( harriet , as emma must suspect , as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy ,) when the carriage reappeared , and all was over . the style of the visit , and the shortness of it , were then felt to be decisive . fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago !-- emma could not but picture it all , and feel how justly they might resent , how naturally harriet must suffer . it was a bad business . she would have given a great deal , or endured a great deal , to have had the martins in a higher rank of life . they were so deserving , that a _little_ higher should have been enough : but as it was , how could she have done otherwise ?-- impossible !-- she could not repent . they must be separated ; but there was a great deal of pain in the process -- so much to herself at this time , that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation , and resolved on going home by way of randalls to procure it . her mind was quite sick of mr . elton and the martins . the refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary . it was a good scheme ; but on driving to the door they heard that neither \" master nor mistress was at home ;\" they had both been out some time ; the man believed they were gone to hartfield . \" this is too bad ,\" cried emma , as they turned away . \" and now we shall just miss them ; too provoking !-- i do not know when i have been so disappointed .\" and she leaned back in the corner , to indulge her murmurs , or to reason them away ; probably a little of both -- such being the commonest process of a not ill - disposed mind . presently the carriage stopt ; she looked up ; it was stopt by mr . and mrs . weston , who were standing to speak to her . there was instant pleasure in the sight of them , and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for mr . weston immediately accosted her with , \" how d \\' ye do ?-- how d \\' ye do ?-- we have been sitting with your father -- glad to see him so well . frank comes to - morrow -- i had a letter this morning -- we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty -- he is at oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; i knew it would be so . if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three days ; i was always glad he did not come at christmas ; now we are going to have just the right weather for him , fine , dry , settled weather . we shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish .\" there was no resisting such news , no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as mr . weston \\' s , confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife , fewer and quieter , but not less to the purpose . to know that _she_ thought his coming certain was enough to make emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy . it was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits . the worn - out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment \\' s thought , she hoped mr . elton would now be talked of no more . mr . weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated . \" i shall soon bring him over to hartfield ,\" said he , at the conclusion . emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife . \" we had better move on , mr . weston ,\" said she , \" we are detaining the girls .\" \" well , well , i am ready ;\"-- and turning again to emma , \" but you must not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man ; you have only had _my_ account you know ; i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary :\"-- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction . emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent , and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing . \" think of me to - morrow , my dear emma , about four o \\' clock ,\" was mrs . weston \\' s parting injunction ; spoken with some anxiety , and meant only for her . \" four o \\' clock !-- depend upon it he will be here by three ,\" was mr . weston \\' s quick amendment ; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting . emma \\' s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness ; every thing wore a different air ; james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before . when she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there . \" will mr . frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford ?\"-- was a question , however , which did not augur much . but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once , and emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time . the morning of the interesting day arrived , and mrs . weston \\' s faithful pupil did not forget either at ten , or eleven , or twelve o \\' clock , that she was to think of her at four . \" my dear , dear anxious friend ,\"-- said she , in mental soliloquy , while walking downstairs from her own room , \" always overcareful for every body \\' s comfort but your own ; i see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right .\" the clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall . \"\\' tis twelve ; i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here . i am sure they will bring him soon .\" she opened the parlour door , and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- mr . weston and his son . they had been arrived only a few minutes , and mr . weston had scarcely finished his explanation of frank \\' s being a day before his time , and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations , when she appeared , to have her share of surprize , introduction , and pleasure . the frank churchill so long talked of , so high in interest , was actually before her -- he was presented to her , and she did not think too much had been said in his praise ; he was a _very_ good looking young man ; height , air , address , all were unexceptionable , and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father \\' s ; he looked quick and sensible . she felt immediately that she should like him ; and there was a well - bred ease of manner , and a readiness to talk , which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her , and that acquainted they soon must be . he had reached randalls the evening before . she was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan , and travel earlier , later , and quicker , that he might gain half a day . \" i told you yesterday ,\" cried mr . weston with exultation , \" i told you all that he would be here before the time named . i remembered what i used to do myself . one cannot creep upon a journey ; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of coming in upon one \\' s friends before the look - out begins , is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs .\" \" it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it ,\" said the young man , \" though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far ; but in coming _home_ i felt i might do any thing .\" the word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency . emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable ; the conviction was strengthened by what followed . he was very much pleased with randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged house , would hardly allow it even to be very small , admired the situation , the walk to highbury , highbury itself , hartfield still more , and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one \\' s _own_ country gives , and the greatest curiosity to visit it . that he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through emma \\' s brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a pleasant one , and pleasantly handled . his manner had no air of study or exaggeration . he did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment . their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance . on his side were the inquiries ,--\" was she a horsewoman ?-- pleasant rides ?-- pleasant walks ?-- had they a large neighbourhood ?-- highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough ?-- there were several very pretty houses in and about it .-- balls -- had they balls ?-- was it a musical society ?\" but when satisfied on all these points , and their acquaintance proportionably advanced , he contrived to find an opportunity , while their two fathers were engaged with each other , of introducing his mother - in - law , and speaking of her with so much handsome praise , so much warm admiration , so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father , and her very kind reception of himself , as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please -- and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her . he did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by mrs . weston ; but , undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter . he understood what would be welcome ; he could be sure of little else . \" his father \\' s marriage ,\" he said , \" had been the wisest measure , every friend must rejoice in it ; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him .\" he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylor \\' s merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouse \\' s character , than miss woodhouse miss taylor \\' s . and at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person . \" elegant , agreeable manners , i was prepared for ,\" said he ; \" but i confess that , considering every thing , i had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs . weston .\" \" you cannot see too much perfection in mrs . weston for my feelings ,\" said emma ; \" were you to guess her to be _eighteen_ , i should listen with pleasure ; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words . don \\' t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman .\" \" i hope i should know better ,\" he replied ; \" no , depend upon it , ( with a gallant bow ,) that in addressing mrs . weston i should understand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms .\" emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other , which had taken strong possession of her mind , had ever crossed his ; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence , or proofs of defiance . she must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable . she had no doubt of what mr . weston was often thinking about . his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression ; and even , when he might have determined not to look , she was confident that he was often listening . her own father \\' s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind , the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion , was a most comfortable circumstance . happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it .-- though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged , he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any ; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons \\' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them . she blessed the favouring blindness . he could now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise , without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest , give way to all his natural kind - hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after mr . frank churchill \\' s accommodation on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road , and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which , however , he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night . a reasonable visit paid , mr . weston began to move .--\" he must be going . he had business at the crown about his hay , and a great many errands for mrs . weston at ford \\' s , but he need not hurry any body else .\" his son , too well bred to hear the hint , rose immediately also , saying , \" as you are going farther on business , sir , i will take the opportunity of paying a visit , which must be paid some day or other , and therefore may as well be paid now . i have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to emma ,) a lady residing in or near highbury ; a family of the name of fairfax . i shall have no difficulty , i suppose , in finding the house ; though fairfax , i believe , is not the proper name -- i should rather say barnes , or bates . do you know any family of that name ?\" \" to be sure we do ,\" cried his father ; \" mrs . bates -- we passed her house -- i saw miss bates at the window . true , true , you are acquainted with miss fairfax ; i remember you knew her at weymouth , and a fine girl she is . call upon her , by all means .\" \" there is no necessity for my calling this morning ,\" said the young man ; \" another day would do as well ; but there was that degree of acquaintance at weymouth which --\" \" oh ! go to - day , go to - day . do not defer it . what is right to be done cannot be done too soon . and , besides , i must give you a hint , frank ; any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided . you saw her with the campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on . if you do not call early it will be a slight .\" the son looked convinced . \" i have heard her speak of the acquaintance ,\" said emma ; \" she is a very elegant young woman .\" he agreed to it , but with so quiet a \" yes ,\" as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if jane fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it . \" if you were never particularly struck by her manners before ,\" said she , \" i think you will to - day . you will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , i am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue .\" \" you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax , sir , are you ?\" said mr . woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; \" then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady . she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; i have known them all my life . they will be extremely glad to see you , i am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way .\" \" my dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me .\" \" but your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street .\" mr . frank churchill still declined it , looking as serious as he could , and his father gave his hearty support by calling out , \" my good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to mrs . bates \\' s , he may get there from the crown in a hop , step , and jump .\" they were permitted to go alone ; and with a cordial nod from one , and a graceful bow from the other , the two gentlemen took leave . emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance , and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of the day , with full confidence in their comfort . chapter vi the next morning brought mr . frank churchill again . he came with mrs . weston , to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially . he had been sitting with her , it appeared , most companionably at home , till her usual hour of exercise ; and on being desired to chuse their walk , immediately fixed on highbury .--\" he did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same . highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking highbury , would be his constant attraction .\"-- highbury , with mrs . weston , stood for hartfield ; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him . they walked thither directly . emma had hardly expected them : for mr . weston , who had called in for half a minute , in order to hear that his son was very handsome , knew nothing of their plans ; and it was an agreeable surprize to her , therefore , to perceive them walking up to the house together , arm in arm . she was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with mrs . weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend . if he were deficient there , nothing should make amends for it . but on seeing them together , she became perfectly satisfied . it was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty ; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection . and there was time enough for emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit included all the rest of the morning . they were all three walking about together for an hour or two -- first round the shrubberies of hartfield , and afterwards in highbury . he was delighted with every thing ; admired hartfield sufficiently for mr . woodhouse \\' s ear ; and when their going farther was resolved on , confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village , and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma could have supposed . some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings . he begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long , and which had been the home of his father \\' s father ; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living , walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other ; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit , they shewed , altogether , a good - will towards highbury in general , which must be very like a merit to those he was with . emma watched and decided , that with such feelings as were now shewn , it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself ; that he had not been acting a part , or making a parade of insincere professions ; and that mr . knightley certainly had not done him justice . their first pause was at the crown inn , an inconsiderable house , though the principal one of the sort , where a couple of pair of post - horses were kept , more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road ; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there ; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added ; it had been built many years ago for a ball - room , and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous , dancing state , had been occasionally used as such ;-- but such brilliant days had long passed away , and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half - gentlemen of the place . he was immediately interested . its character as a ball - room caught him ; and instead of passing on , he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open , to look in and contemplate its capabilities , and lament that its original purpose should have ceased . he saw no fault in the room , he would acknowledge none which they suggested . no , it was long enough , broad enough , handsome enough . it would hold the very number for comfort . they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter . why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room ?-- she who could do any thing in highbury ! the want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied . he could not be persuaded that so many good - looking houses as he saw around him , could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and even when particulars were given and families described , he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing , or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body \\' s returning into their proper place the next morning . he argued like a young man very much bent on dancing ; and emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the churchills . he seemed to have all the life and spirit , cheerful feelings , and social inclinations of his father , and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe . of pride , indeed , there was , perhaps , scarcely enough ; his indifference to a confusion of rank , bordered too much on inelegance of mind . he could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap . it was but an effusion of lively spirits . at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown ; and being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged , emma recollected his intended visit the day before , and asked him if he had paid it . \" yes , oh ! yes \"-- he replied ; \" i was just going to mention it . a very successful visit :-- i saw all the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint . if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me . as it was , i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit . ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before him -- but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , i found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour . the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before .\" \" and how did you think miss fairfax looking ?\" \" ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill . but the expression is hardly admissible , mrs . weston , is it ? ladies can never look ill . and , seriously , miss fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health .-- a most deplorable want of complexion .\" emma would not agree to this , and began a warm defence of miss fairfax \\' s complexion . \" it was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face .\" he listened with all due deference ; acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same -- but yet he must confess , that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health . where features were indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all ; and where they were good , the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was . \" well ,\" said emma , \" there is no disputing about taste .-- at least you admire her except her complexion .\" he shook his head and laughed .--\" i cannot separate miss fairfax and her complexion .\" \" did you see her often at weymouth ? were you often in the same society ?\" at this moment they were approaching ford \\' s , and he hastily exclaimed , \" ha ! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives , as my father informs me . he comes to highbury himself , he says , six days out of the seven , and has always business at ford \\' s . if it be not inconvenient to you , pray let us go in , that i may prove myself to belong to the place , to be a true citizen of highbury . i must buy something at ford \\' s . it will be taking out my freedom .-- i dare say they sell gloves .\" \" oh ! yes , gloves and every thing . i do admire your patriotism . you will be adored in highbury . you were very popular before you came , because you were mr . weston \\' s son -- but lay out half a guinea at ford \\' s , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues .\" they went in ; and while the sleek , well - tied parcels of \" men \\' s beavers \" and \" york tan \" were bringing down and displaying on the counter , he said --\" but i beg your pardon , miss woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_ _patriae_ . do not let me lose it . i assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life .\" \" i merely asked , whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth .\" \" and now that i understand your question , i must pronounce it to be a very unfair one . it is always the lady \\' s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance . miss fairfax must already have given her account .-- i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow .\" \" upon my word ! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself . but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed , she is so very reserved , so very unwilling to give the least information about any body , that i really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her .\" \" may i , indeed ?-- then i will speak the truth , and nothing suits me so well . i met her frequently at weymouth . i had known the campbells a little in town ; and at weymouth we were very much in the same set . colonel campbell is a very agreeable man , and mrs . campbell a friendly , warm - hearted woman . i like them all .\" \" you know miss fairfax \\' s situation in life , i conclude ; what she is destined to be ?\" \" yes --( rather hesitatingly )-- i believe i do .\" \" you get upon delicate subjects , emma ,\" said mrs . weston smiling ; \" remember that i am here .-- mr . frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax \\' s situation in life . i will move a little farther off .\" \" i certainly do forget to think of _her_ ,\" said emma , \" as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend .\" he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment . when the gloves were bought , and they had quitted the shop again , \" did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ?\" said frank churchill . \" ever hear her !\" repeated emma . \" you forget how much she belongs to highbury . i have heard her every year of our lives since we both began . she plays charmingly .\" \" you think so , do you ?-- i wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge . she appeared to me to play well , that is , with considerable taste , but i know nothing of the matter myself .-- i am excessively fond of music , but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body \\' s performance .-- i have been used to hear her \\' s admired ; and i remember one proof of her being thought to play well :-- a man , a very musical man , and in love with another woman -- engaged to her -- on the point of marriage -- would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument , if the lady in question could sit down instead -- never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other . that , i thought , in a man of known musical talent , was some proof .\" \" proof indeed !\" said emma , highly amused .--\" mr . dixon is very musical , is he ? we shall know more about them all , in half an hour , from you , than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year .\" \" yes , mr . dixon and miss campbell were the persons ; and i thought it a very strong proof .\" \" certainly -- very strong it was ; to own the truth , a great deal stronger than , if _i_ had been miss campbell , would have been at all agreeable to me . i could not excuse a man \\' s having more music than love -- more ear than eye -- a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings . how did miss campbell appear to like it ?\" \" it was her very particular friend , you know .\" \" poor comfort !\" said emma , laughing . \" one would rather have a stranger preferred than one \\' s very particular friend -- with a stranger it might not recur again -- but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand , to do every thing better than one does oneself !-- poor mrs . dixon ! well , i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland .\" \" you are right . it was not very flattering to miss campbell ; but she really did not seem to feel it .\" \" so much the better -- or so much the worse :-- i do not know which . but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her -- quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling -- there was one person , i think , who must have felt it : miss fairfax herself . she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction .\" \" as to that -- i do not --\" \" oh ! do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfax \\' s sensations from you , or from any body else . they are known to no human being , i guess , but herself . but if she continued to play whenever she was asked by mr . dixon , one may guess what one chuses .\" \" there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all --\" he began rather quickly , but checking himself , added , \" however , it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were -- how it might all be behind the scenes . i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly . but you , who have known miss fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than i can be .\" \" i have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate ,-- that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends . but we never did . i hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set . and then , her reserve -- i never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved .\" \" it is a most repulsive quality , indeed ,\" said he . \" oftentimes very convenient , no doubt , but never pleasing . there is safety in reserve , but no attraction . one cannot love a reserved person .\" \" not till the reserve ceases towards oneself ; and then the attraction may be the greater . but i must be more in want of a friend , or an agreeable companion , than i have yet been , to take the trouble of conquering any body \\' s reserve to procure one . intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question . i have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal .\" he perfectly agreed with her : and after walking together so long , and thinking so much alike , emma felt herself so well acquainted with him , that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting . he was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected . his ideas seemed more moderate -- his feelings warmer . she was particularly struck by his manner of considering mr . elton \\' s house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with . no , he could not believe it a bad house ; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having . if it were to be shared with the woman he loved , he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house . there must be ample room in it for every real comfort . the man must be a blockhead who wanted more . mrs . weston laughed , and said he did not know what he was talking about . used only to a large house himself , and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size , he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one . but emma , in her own mind , determined that he _did_ know what he was talking about , and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life , and to marry , from worthy motives . he might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper \\' s room , or a bad butler \\' s pantry , but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make him happy , and that whenever he were attached , he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment . chapter vii emma \\' s very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken the following day , by hearing that he was gone off to london , merely to have his hair cut . a sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast , and he had sent for a chaise and set off , intending to return to dinner , but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut . there was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand ; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve . it did not accord with the rationality of plan , the moderation in expense , or even the unselfish warmth of heart , which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday . vanity , extravagance , love of change , restlessness of temper , which must be doing something , good or bad ; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and mrs . weston , indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general ; he became liable to all these charges . his father only called him a coxcomb , and thought it a very good story ; but that mrs . weston did not like it , was clear enough , by her passing it over as quickly as possible , and making no other comment than that \" all young people would have their little whims .\" with the exception of this little blot , emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him . mrs . weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether . he appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect . this was all very promising ; and , but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut , there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him ; the honour , if not of being really in love with her , of being at least very near it , and saved only by her own indifference -- ( for still her resolution held of never marrying )-- the honour , in short , of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance . mr . weston , on his side , added a virtue to the account which must have some weight . he gave her to understand that frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly . as mrs . weston observed , \" all young people would have their little whims .\" there was one person among his new acquaintance in surry , not so leniently disposed . in general he was judged , throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man -- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- mr . knightley . the circumstance was told him at hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , \" hum ! just the trifling , silly fellow i took him for .\" she had half a mind to resent ; but an instant \\' s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass . although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , mr . and mrs . weston \\' s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune . something occurred while they were at hartfield , to make emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave . this was the occurrence :-- the coles had been settled some years in highbury , and were very good sort of people -- friendly , liberal , and unpretending ; but , on the other hand , they were of low origin , in trade , and only moderately genteel . on their first coming into the country , they had lived in proportion to their income , quietly , keeping little company , and that little unexpensively ; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means -- the house in town had yielded greater profits , and fortune in general had smiled on them . with their wealth , their views increased ; their want of a larger house , their inclination for more company . they added to their house , to their number of servants , to their expenses of every sort ; and by this time were , in fortune and style of living , second only to the family at hartfield . their love of society , and their new dining - room , prepared every body for their keeping dinner - company ; and a few parties , chiefly among the single men , had already taken place . the regular and best families emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite -- neither donwell , nor hartfield , nor randalls . nothing should tempt _her_ to go , if they did ; and she regretted that her father \\' s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish . the coles were very respectable in their way , but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them . this lesson , she very much feared , they would receive only from herself ; she had little hope of mr . knightley , none of mr . weston . but she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared , that when the insult came at last , it found her very differently affected . donwell and randalls had received their invitation , and none had come for her father and herself ; and mrs . weston \\' s accounting for it with \" i suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out ,\" was not quite sufficient . she felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal ; and afterwards , as the idea of the party to be assembled there , consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her , occurred again and again , she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept . harriet was to be there in the evening , and the bateses . they had been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before , and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence . might not the evening end in a dance ? had been a question of his . the bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits ; and her being left in solitary grandeur , even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment , was but poor comfort . it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that \" of course it must be declined ,\" she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful . she owned that , considering every thing , she was not absolutely without inclination for the party . the coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it -- so much consideration for her father . \" they would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from london , which they hoped might keep mr . woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company .\" upon the whole , she was very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly mrs . goddard , if not mrs . bates , might be depended on for bearing him company -- mr . woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter \\' s going out to dinner on a day now near at hand , and spending the whole evening away from him . as for _his_ going , emma did not wish him to think it possible , the hours would be too late , and the party too numerous . he was soon pretty well resigned . \" i am not fond of dinner - visiting ,\" said he --\" i never was . no more is emma . late hours do not agree with us . i am sorry mr . and mrs . cole should have done it . i think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening . the dews of a summer evening are what i would not expose any body to . however , as they are so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and mr . knightley too , to take care of her , i cannot wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy .\" then turning to mrs . weston , with a look of gentle reproach --\" ah ! miss taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me .\" \" well , sir ,\" cried mr . weston , \" as i took miss taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if i can ; and i will step to mrs . goddard in a moment , if you wish it .\" but the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_ , was increasing , not lessening , mr . woodhouse \\' s agitation . the ladies knew better how to allay it . mr . weston must be quiet , and every thing deliberately arranged . with this treatment , mr . woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual . \" he should be happy to see mrs . goddard . he had a great regard for mrs . goddard ; and emma should write a line , and invite her . james could take the note . but first of all , there must be an answer written to mrs . cole .\" \" you will make my excuses , my dear , as civilly as possible . you will say that i am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my _compliments_ , of course . but you will do every thing right . i need not tell you what is to be done . we must remember to let james know that the carriage will be wanted on tuesday . i shall have no fears for you with him . we have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely . and when you get there , you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again ; and you had better name an early hour . you will not like staying late . you will get very tired when tea is over .\" \" but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired , papa ?\" \" oh ! no , my love ; but you will soon be tired . there will be a great many people talking at once . you will not like the noise .\" \" but , my dear sir ,\" cried mr . weston , \" if emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party .\" \" and no great harm if it does ,\" said mr . woodhouse . \" the sooner every party breaks up , the better .\" \" but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles . emma \\' s going away directly after tea might be giving offence . they are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body \\' s hurrying away is no great compliment ; and miss woodhouse \\' s doing it would be more thought of than any other person \\' s in the room . you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles , i am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort of people as ever lived , and who have been your neighbours these _ten_ years .\" \" no , upon no account in the world , mr . weston ; i am much obliged to you for reminding me . i should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain . i know what worthy people they are . perry tells me that mr . cole never touches malt liquor . you would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious -- mr . cole is very bilious . no , i would not be the means of giving them any pain . my dear emma , we must consider this . i am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting mr . and mrs . cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish . you will not regard being tired . you will be perfectly safe , you know , among your friends .\" \" oh yes , papa . i have no fears at all for myself ; and i should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs . weston , but on your account . i am only afraid of your sitting up for me . i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs . goddard . she loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , i am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort . you must promise me not to sit up .\" he did , on the condition of some promises on her side : such as that , if she came home cold , she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly ; if hungry , that she would take something to eat ; that her own maid should sit up for her ; and that serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house , as usual . chapter viii frank churchill came back again ; and if he kept his father \\' s dinner waiting , it was not known at hartfield ; for mrs . weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr . woodhouse , to betray any imperfection which could be concealed . he came back , had had his hair cut , and laughed at himself with a very good grace , but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done . he had no reason to wish his hair longer , to conceal any confusion of face ; no reason to wish the money unspent , to improve his spirits . he was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever ; and , after seeing him , emma thus moralised to herself :-- \" i do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way . wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly .-- it depends upon the character of those who handle it . mr . knightley , he is _not_ a trifling , silly young man . if he were , he would have done this differently . he would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it . there would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities .-- no , i am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly .\" with tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again , and for a longer time than hitherto ; of judging of his general manners , and by inference , of the meaning of his manners towards herself ; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air ; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be , who were now seeing them together for the first time . she meant to be very happy , in spite of the scene being laid at mr . cole \\' s ; and without being able to forget that among the failings of mr . elton , even in the days of his favour , none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with mr . cole . her father \\' s comfort was amply secured , mrs . bates as well as mrs . goddard being able to come ; and her last pleasing duty , before she left the house , was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner ; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress , to make the two ladies all the amends in her power , by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , for whatever unwilling self - denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal .-- she had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it . she followed another carriage to mr . cole \\' s door ; and was pleased to see that it was mr . knightley \\' s ; for mr . knightley keeping no horses , having little spare money and a great deal of health , activity , and independence , was too apt , in emma \\' s opinion , to get about as he could , and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of donwell abbey . she had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart , for he stopped to hand her out . \" this is coming as you should do ,\" said she ; \" like a gentleman .-- i am quite glad to see you .\" he thanked her , observing , \" how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment ! for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , i doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual .-- you might not have distinguished how i came , by my look or manner .\" \" yes i should , i am sure i should . there is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them . you think you carry it off very well , i dare say , but with you it is a sort of bravado , an air of affected unconcern ; i always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances . _now_ you have nothing to try for . you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed . you are not striving to look taller than any body else . _now_ i shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you .\" \" nonsensical girl !\" was his reply , but not at all in anger . emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with mr . knightley . she was received with a cordial respect which could not but please , and given all the consequence she could wish for . when the westons arrived , the kindest looks of love , the strongest of admiration were for her , from both husband and wife ; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object , and at dinner she found him seated by her -- and , as she firmly believed , not without some dexterity on his side . the party was rather large , as it included one other family , a proper unobjectionable country family , whom the coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance , and the male part of mr . cox \\' s family , the lawyer of highbury . the less worthy females were to come in the evening , with miss bates , miss fairfax , and miss smith ; but already , at dinner , they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general ; and , while politics and mr . elton were talked over , emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour . the first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend , was the name of jane fairfax . mrs . cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting . she listened , and found it well worth listening to . that very dear part of emma , her fancy , received an amusing supply . mrs . cole was telling that she had been calling on miss bates , and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte -- a very elegant looking instrument -- not a grand , but a large - sized square pianoforte ; and the substance of the story , the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize , and inquiry , and congratulations on her side , and explanations on miss bates \\' s , was , that this pianoforte had arrived from broadwood \\' s the day before , to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected ; that at first , by miss bates \\' s account , jane herself was quite at a loss , quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it -- but now , they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter ;-- of course it must be from colonel campbell . \" one can suppose nothing else ,\" added mrs . cole , \" and i was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt . but jane , it seems , had a letter from them very lately , and not a word was said about it . she knows their ways best ; but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present . they might chuse to surprize her .\" mrs . cole had many to agree with her ; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell , and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made ; and there were enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way , and still listen to mrs . cole . \" i declare , i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction !-- it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument . it seemed quite a shame , especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away . this is like giving ourselves a slap , to be sure ! and it was but yesterday i was telling mr . cole , i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room , while i do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor jane fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with .-- i was saying this to mr . cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought -- or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it .-- we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening .\" miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence ; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs . cole \\' s , turned to frank churchill . \" why do you smile ?\" said she . \" nay , why do you ?\" \" me !-- i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbell \\' s being so rich and so liberal .-- it is a handsome present .\" \" very .\" \" i rather wonder that it was never made before .\" \" perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before .\" \" or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument -- which must now be shut up in london , untouched by any body .\" \" that is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for mrs . bates \\' s house .\" \" you may _say_ what you chuse -- but your countenance testifies that your _thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine .\" \" i do not know . i rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than i deserve . i smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect ; but at present i do not see what there is to question . if colonel campbell is not the person , who can be ?\" \" what do you say to mrs . dixon ?\" \" mrs . dixon ! very true indeed . i had not thought of mrs . dixon . she must know as well as her father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the surprize , is more like a young woman \\' s scheme than an elderly man \\' s . it is mrs . dixon , i dare say . i told you that your suspicions would guide mine .\" \" if so , you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _mr_ . dixon in them .\" \" mr . dixon .-- very well . yes , i immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of mr . and mrs . dixon . we were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance .\" \" yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which i had entertained before .-- i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr . dixon or miss fairfax , but i cannot help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side . one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but i am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland . here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment . as to the pretence of trying her native air , i look upon that as a mere excuse .-- in the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body \\' s native air do for them in the months of january , february , and march ? good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health , and i dare say in her \\' s . i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but i honestly tell you what they are .\" \" and , upon my word , they have an air of great probability . mr . dixon \\' s preference of her music to her friend \\' s , i can answer for being very decided .\" \" and then , he saved her life . did you ever hear of that ?-- a water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard . he caught her .\" \" he did . i was there -- one of the party .\" \" were you really ?-- well !-- but you observed nothing of course , for it seems to be a new idea to you .-- if i had been there , i think i should have made some discoveries .\" \" i dare say you would ; but i , simple i , saw nothing but the fact , that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr . dixon caught her .-- it was the work of a moment . and though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable -- indeed i believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again -- yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable . i do not mean to say , however , that you might not have made discoveries .\" the conversation was here interrupted . they were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses , and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others ; but when the table was again safely covered , when every corner dish was placed exactly right , and occupation and ease were generally restored , emma said , \" the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me . i wanted to know a little more , and this tells me quite enough . depend upon it , we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr . and mrs . dixon .\" \" and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells .\" \" no , i am sure it is not from the campbells . miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells , or they would have been guessed at first . she would not have been puzzled , had she dared fix on them . i may not have convinced you perhaps , but i am perfectly convinced myself that mr . dixon is a principal in the business .\" \" indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced . your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely . at first , while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver , i saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world . but when you mentioned mrs . dixon , i felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love .\" there was no occasion to press the matter farther . the conviction seemed real ; he looked as if he felt it . she said no more , other subjects took their turn ; and the rest of the dinner passed away ; the dessert succeeded , the children came in , and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation ; a few clever things said , a few downright silly , but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks , dull repetitions , old news , and heavy jokes . the ladies had not been long in the drawing - room , before the other ladies , in their different divisions , arrived . emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend ; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace , she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner , but could most heartily rejoice in that light , cheerful , unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure , in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection . there she sat -- and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding ? to be in company , nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed , to sit and smile and look pretty , and say nothing , was enough for the happiness of the present hour . jane fairfax did look and move superior ; but emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with harriet , very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes , of having loved even mr . elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend . in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her . she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte , she felt too much in the secret herself , to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair , and therefore purposely kept at a distance ; but by the others , the subject was almost immediately introduced , and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received , the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of \" my excellent friend colonel campbell .\" mrs . weston , kind - hearted and musical , was particularly interested by the circumstance , and emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject ; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone , touch , and pedal , totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible , which she plainly read in the fair heroine \\' s countenance . they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen ; and the very first of the early was frank churchill . in he walked , the first and the handsomest ; and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and her niece , made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle , where sat miss woodhouse ; and till he could find a seat by her , would not sit at all . emma divined what every body present must be thinking . she was his object , and every body must perceive it . she introduced him to her friend , miss smith , and , at convenient moments afterwards , heard what each thought of the other . \" he had never seen so lovely a face , and was delighted with her naivete .\" and she , \" only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like mr . elton .\" emma restrained her indignation , and only turned from her in silence . smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards miss fairfax ; but it was most prudent to avoid speech . he told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining - room -- hated sitting long -- was always the first to move when he could -- that his father , mr . knightley , mr . cox , and mr . cole , were left very busy over parish business -- that as long as he had staid , however , it had been pleasant enough , as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike , sensible men ; and spoke so handsomely of highbury altogether -- thought it so abundant in agreeable families -- that emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much . she questioned him as to the society in yorkshire -- the extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out from his answers that , as far as enscombe was concerned , there was very little going on , that their visitings were among a range of great families , none very near ; and that even when days were fixed , and invitations accepted , it was an even chance that mrs . churchill were not in health and spirits for going ; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person ; and that , though he had his separate engagements , it was not without difficulty , without considerable address _at_ _times_ , that he could get away , or introduce an acquaintance for a night . she saw that enscombe could not satisfy , and that highbury , taken at its best , might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked . his importance at enscombe was very evident . he did not boast , but it naturally betrayed itself , that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing , and on her laughing and noticing it , he owned that he believed ( excepting one or two points ) he could _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing . one of those points on which his influence failed , he then mentioned . he had wanted very much to go abroad -- had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel -- but she would not hear of it . this had happened the year before . _now_ , he said , he was beginning to have no longer the same wish . the unpersuadable point , which he did not mention , emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father . \" i have made a most wretched discovery ,\" said he , after a short pause .-- \" i have been here a week to - morrow -- half my time . i never knew days fly so fast . a week to - morrow !-- and i have hardly begun to enjoy myself . but just got acquainted with mrs . weston , and others !-- i hate the recollection .\" \" perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut .\" \" no ,\" said he , smiling , \" that is no subject of regret at all . i have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless i can believe myself fit to be seen .\" the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to mr . cole . when mr . cole had moved away , and her attention could be restored as before , she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room at miss fairfax , who was sitting exactly opposite . \" what is the matter ?\" said she . he started . \" thank you for rousing me ,\" he replied . \" i believe i have been very rude ; but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that i cannot keep my eyes from her . i never saw any thing so outree !-- those curls !-- this must be a fancy of her own . i see nobody else looking like her !-- i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion . shall i ?-- yes , i will -- i declare i will -- and you shall see how she takes it ;-- whether she colours .\" he was gone immediately ; and emma soon saw him standing before miss fairfax , and talking to her ; but as to its effect on the young lady , as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them , exactly in front of miss fairfax , she could absolutely distinguish nothing . before he could return to his chair , it was taken by mrs . weston . \" this is the luxury of a large party ,\" said she :--\" one can get near every body , and say every thing . my dear emma , i am longing to talk to you . i have been making discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and i must tell them while the idea is fresh . do you know how miss bates and her niece came here ?\" \" how ?-- they were invited , were not they ?\" \" oh ! yes -- but how they were conveyed hither ?-- the manner of their coming ?\" \" they walked , i conclude . how else could they come ?\" \" very true .-- well , a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again , late at night , and cold as the nights are now . and as i looked at her , though i never saw her appear to more advantage , it struck me that she was heated , and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold . poor girl ! i could not bear the idea of it ; so , as soon as mr . weston came into the room , and i could get at him , i spoke to him about the carriage . you may guess how readily he came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , i made my way directly to miss bates , to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home ; for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once . good soul ! she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure . ` nobody was ever so fortunate as herself !\\'-- but with many , many thanks --` there was no occasion to trouble us , for mr . knightley \\' s carriage had brought , and was to take them home again .\\' i was quite surprized ;-- very glad , i am sure ; but really quite surprized . such a very kind attention -- and so thoughtful an attention !-- the sort of thing that so few men would think of . and , in short , from knowing his usual ways , i am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all . i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself , and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them .\" \" very likely ,\" said emma --\" nothing more likely . i know no man more likely than mr . knightley to do the sort of thing -- to do any thing really good - natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent . he is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering jane fairfax \\' s ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him ;-- and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr . knightley . i know he had horses to - day -- for we arrived together ; and i laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray .\" \" well ,\" said mrs . weston , smiling , \" you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do ; for while miss bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and i have never been able to get it out again . the more i think of it , the more probable it appears . in short , i have made a match between mr . knightley and jane fairfax . see the consequence of keeping you company !-- what do you say to it ?\" \" mr . knightley and jane fairfax !\" exclaimed emma . \" dear mrs . weston , how could you think of such a thing ?-- mr . knightley !-- mr . knightley must not marry !-- you would not have little henry cut out from donwell ?-- oh ! no , no , henry must have donwell . i cannot at all consent to mr . knightley \\' s marrying ; and i am sure it is not at all likely . i am amazed that you should think of such a thing .\" \" my dear emma , i have told you what led me to think of it . i do not want the match -- i do not want to injure dear little henry -- but the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if mr . knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on henry \\' s account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ?\" \" yes , i would . i could not bear to have henry supplanted .-- mr . knightley marry !-- no , i have never had such an idea , and i cannot adopt it now . and jane fairfax , too , of all women !\" \" nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know .\" \" but the imprudence of such a match !\" \" i am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability .\" \" i see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention . his good - nature , his humanity , as i tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses . he has a great regard for the bateses , you know , independent of jane fairfax -- and is always glad to shew them attention . my dear mrs . weston , do not take to match - making . you do it very ill . jane fairfax mistress of the abbey !-- oh ! no , no ;-- every feeling revolts . for his own sake , i would not have him do so mad a thing .\" \" imprudent , if you please -- but not mad . excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , i can see nothing unsuitable .\" \" but mr . knightley does not want to marry . i am sure he has not the least idea of it . do not put it into his head . why should he marry ?-- he is as happy as possible by himself ; with his farm , and his sheep , and his library , and all the parish to manage ; and he is extremely fond of his brother \\' s children . he has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart .\" \" my dear emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves jane fairfax --\" \" nonsense ! he does not care about jane fairfax . in the way of love , i am sure he does not . he would do any good to her , or her family ; but --\" \" well ,\" said mrs . weston , laughing , \" perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give jane such a respectable home .\" \" if it would be good to her , i am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion . how would he bear to have miss bates belonging to him ?-- to have her haunting the abbey , and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane ?-- ` so very kind and obliging !-- but he always had been such a very kind neighbour !\\' and then fly off , through half a sentence , to her mother \\' s old petticoat . ` not that it was such a very old petticoat either -- for still it would last a great while -- and , indeed , she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong .\\'\" \" for shame , emma ! do not mimic her . you divert me against my conscience . and , upon my word , i do not think mr . knightley would be much disturbed by miss bates . little things do not irritate him . she might talk on ; and if he wanted to say any thing himself , he would only talk louder , and drown her voice . but the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and i think he does . i have heard him speak , and so must you , so very highly of jane fairfax ! the interest he takes in her -- his anxiety about her health -- his concern that she should have no happier prospect ! i have heard him express himself so warmly on those points !-- such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte , and of her voice ! i have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever . oh ! and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody -- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the campbells , may it not be from mr . knightley ? i cannot help suspecting him . i think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love .\" \" then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love . but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do . mr . knightley does nothing mysteriously .\" \" i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly ; oftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would , in the common course of things , occur to him .\" \" very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so .\" \" there might be scruples of delicacy , my dear emma . i have a very strong notion that it comes from him . i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs . cole told us of it at dinner .\" \" you take up an idea , mrs . weston , and run away with it ; as you have many a time reproached me with doing . i see no sign of attachment -- i believe nothing of the pianoforte -- and proof only shall convince me that mr . knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax .\" they combated the point some time longer in the same way ; emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend ; for mrs . weston was the most used of the two to yield ; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over , and the instrument in preparation ;-- and at the same moment mr . cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it . frank churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs . weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax , followed mr . cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance . she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well . one accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize -- a second , slightly but correctly taken by frank churchill . her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song , and every thing usual followed . he was accused of having a delightful voice , and a perfect knowledge of music ; which was properly denied ; and that he knew nothing of the matter , and had no voice at all , roundly asserted . they sang together once more ; and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax , whose performance , both vocal and instrumental , she never could attempt to conceal from herself , was infinitely superior to her own . with mixed feelings , she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument , to listen . frank churchill sang again . they had sung together once or twice , it appeared , at weymouth . but the sight of mr . knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half emma \\' s mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of mrs . weston \\' s suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions . her objections to mr . knightley \\' s marrying did not in the least subside . she could see nothing but evil in it . it would be a great disappointment to mr . john knightley ; consequently to isabella . a real injury to the children -- a most mortifying change , and material loss to them all ;-- a very great deduction from her father \\' s daily comfort -- and , as to herself , she could not at all endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey . a mrs . knightley for them all to give way to !-- no -- mr . knightley must never marry . little henry must remain the heir of donwell . presently mr . knightley looked back , and came and sat down by her . they talked at first only of the performance . his admiration was certainly very warm ; yet she thought , but for mrs . weston , it would not have struck her . as a sort of touchstone , however , she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece ; and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short , she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own . \" i often feel concern ,\" said she , \" that i dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions . it is not that i am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should put - to for such a purpose .\" \" quite out of the question , quite out of the question ,\" he replied ;-- \" but you must often wish it , i am sure .\" and he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction , that she must proceed another step . \" this present from the campbells ,\" said she --\" this pianoforte is very kindly given .\" \" yes ,\" he replied , and without the smallest apparent embarrassment .-- \" but they would have done better had they given her notice of it . surprizes are foolish things . the pleasure is not enhanced , and the inconvenience is often considerable . i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell .\" from that moment , emma could have taken her oath that mr . knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument . but whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment -- whether there were no actual preference -- remained a little longer doubtful . towards the end of jane \\' s second song , her voice grew thick . \" that will do ,\" said he , when it was finished , thinking aloud -- \" you have sung quite enough for one evening -- now be quiet .\" another song , however , was soon begged for . \" one more ;-- they would not fatigue miss fairfax on any account , and would only ask for one more .\" and frank churchill was heard to say , \" i think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling . the strength of the song falls on the second .\" mr . knightley grew angry . \" that fellow ,\" said he , indignantly , \" thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice . this must not be .\" and touching miss bates , who at that moment passed near --\" miss bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ? go , and interfere . they have no mercy on her .\" miss bates , in her real anxiety for jane , could hardly stay even to be grateful , before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing . here ceased the concert part of the evening , for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers ; but soon ( within five minutes ) the proposal of dancing -- originating nobody exactly knew where -- was so effectually promoted by mr . and mrs . cole , that every thing was rapidly clearing away , to give proper space . mrs . weston , capital in her country - dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and frank churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top . while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off , emma found time , in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste , to look about , and see what became of mr . knightley . this would be a trial . he was no dancer in general . if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now , it might augur something . there was no immediate appearance . no ; he was talking to mrs . cole -- he was looking on unconcerned ; jane was asked by somebody else , and he was still talking to mrs . cole . emma had no longer an alarm for henry ; his interest was yet safe ; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment . not more than five couple could be mustered ; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful , and she found herself well matched in a partner . they were a couple worth looking at . two dances , unfortunately , were all that could be allowed . it was growing late , and miss bates became anxious to get home , on her mother \\' s account . after some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank mrs . weston , look sorrowful , and have done . \" perhaps it is as well ,\" said frank churchill , as he attended emma to her carriage . \" i must have asked miss fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after your \\' s .\" chapter ix emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles . the visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day ; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion , must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity . she must have delighted the coles -- worthy people , who deserved to be made happy !-- and left a name behind her that would not soon die away . perfect happiness , even in memory , is not common ; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy . she doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her suspicions of jane fairfax \\' s feelings to frank churchill . it was hardly right ; but it had been so strong an idea , that it would escape her , and his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue . the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax ; and there she had no doubt . she did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing . she did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood -- and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half . she was then interrupted by harriet \\' s coming in ; and if harriet \\' s praise could have satisfied her , she might soon have been comforted . \" oh ! if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax !\" \" don \\' t class us together , harriet . my playing is no more like her \\' s , than a lamp is like sunshine .\" \" oh ! dear -- i think you play the best of the two . i think you play quite as well as she does . i am sure i had much rather hear you . every body last night said how well you played .\" \" those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference . the truth is , harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but jane fairfax \\' s is much beyond it .\" \" well , i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out . mr . cole said how much taste you had ; and mr . frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution .\" \" ah ! but jane fairfax has them both , harriet .\" \" are you sure ? i saw she had execution , but i did not know she had any taste . nobody talked about it . and i hate italian singing .-- there is no understanding a word of it . besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach . the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family . how did you think the coxes looked ?\" \" just as they always do -- very vulgar .\" \" they told me something ,\" said harriet rather hesitatingly ;\" but it is nothing of any consequence .\" emma was obliged to ask what they had told her , though fearful of its producing mr . elton . \" they told me -- that mr . martin dined with them last saturday .\" \" oh !\" \" he came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner .\" \" oh !\" \" they talked a great deal about him , especially anne cox . i do not know what she meant , but she asked me if i thought i should go and stay there again next summer .\" \" she meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an anne cox should be .\" \" she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there . he sat by her at dinner . miss nash thinks either of the coxes would be very glad to marry him .\" \" very likely .-- i think they are , without exception , the most vulgar girls in highbury .\" harriet had business at ford \\' s .-- emma thought it most prudent to go with her . another accidental meeting with the martins was possible , and in her present state , would be dangerous . harriet , tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word , was always very long at a purchase ; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind , emma went to the door for amusement .-- much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury ;-- mr . perry walking hastily by , mr . william cox letting himself in at the office - door , mr . cole \\' s carriage - horses returning from exercise , or a stray letter - boy on an obstinate mule , were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect ; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray , a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket , two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone , and a string of dawdling children round the baker \\' s little bow - window eyeing the gingerbread , she knew she had no reason to complain , and was amused enough ; quite enough still to stand at the door . a mind lively and at ease , can do with seeing nothing , and can see nothing that does not answer . she looked down the randalls road . the scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; mrs . weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into highbury ;-- to hartfield of course . they were stopping , however , in the first place at mrs . bates \\' s ; whose house was a little nearer randalls than ford \\' s ; and had all but knocked , when emma caught their eye .-- immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her ; and the agreeableness of yesterday \\' s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting . mrs . weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses , in order to hear the new instrument . \" for my companion tells me ,\" said she , \" that i absolutely promised miss bates last night , that i would come this morning . i was not aware of it myself . i did not know that i had fixed a day , but as he says i did , i am going now .\" \" and while mrs . weston pays her visit , i may be allowed , i hope ,\" said frank churchill , \" to join your party and wait for her at hartfield -- if you are going home .\" mrs . weston was disappointed . \" i thought you meant to go with me . they would be very much pleased .\" \" me ! i should be quite in the way . but , perhaps -- i may be equally in the way here . miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me . my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping . she says i fidget her to death ; and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same . what am i to do ?\" \" i am here on no business of my own ,\" said emma ; \" i am only waiting for my friend . she will probably have soon done , and then we shall go home . but you had better go with mrs . weston and hear the instrument .\" \" well -- if you advise it .-- but ( with a smile ) if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend , and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone -- what shall i say ? i shall be no support to mrs . weston . she might do very well by herself . a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood .\" \" i do not believe any such thing ,\" replied emma .--\" i am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours , when it is necessary ; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent . quite otherwise indeed , if i understood miss fairfax \\' s opinion last night .\" \" do come with me ,\" said mrs . weston , \" if it be not very disagreeable to you . it need not detain us long . we will go to hartfield afterwards . we will follow them to hartfield . i really wish you to call with me . it will be felt so great an attention ! and i always thought you meant it .\" he could say no more ; and with the hope of hartfield to reward him , returned with mrs . weston to mrs . bates \\' s door . emma watched them in , and then joined harriet at the interesting counter ,-- trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern . at last it was all settled , even to the destination of the parcel . \" should i send it to mrs . goddard \\' s , ma \\' am ?\" asked mrs . ford .-- \" yes -- no -- yes , to mrs . goddard \\' s . only my pattern gown is at hartfield . no , you shall send it to hartfield , if you please . but then , mrs . goddard will want to see it .-- and i could take the pattern gown home any day . but i shall want the ribbon directly -- so it had better go to hartfield -- at least the ribbon . you could make it into two parcels , mrs . ford , could not you ?\" \" it is not worth while , harriet , to give mrs . ford the trouble of two parcels .\" \" no more it is .\" \" no trouble in the world , ma \\' am ,\" said the obliging mrs . ford . \" oh ! but indeed i would much rather have it only in one . then , if you please , you shall send it all to mrs . goddard \\' s -- i do not know -- no , i think , miss woodhouse , i may just as well have it sent to hartfield , and take it home with me at night . what do you advise ?\" \" that you do not give another half - second to the subject . to hartfield , if you please , mrs . ford .\" \" aye , that will be much best ,\" said harriet , quite satisfied , \" i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs . goddard \\' s .\" voices approached the shop -- or rather one voice and two ladies : mrs . weston and miss bates met them at the door . \" my dear miss woodhouse ,\" said the latter , \" i am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while , and give us your opinion of our new instrument ; you and miss smith . how do you do , miss smith ?-- very well i thank you .-- and i begged mrs . weston to come with me , that i might be sure of succeeding .\" \" i hope mrs . bates and miss fairfax are --\" \" very well , i am much obliged to you . my mother is delightfully well ; and jane caught no cold last night . how is mr . woodhouse ?-- i am so glad to hear such a good account . mrs . weston told me you were here .-- oh ! then , said i , i must run across , i am sure miss woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in ; my mother will be so very happy to see her -- and now we are such a nice party , she cannot refuse .--` aye , pray do ,\\' said mr . frank churchill , ` miss woodhouse \\' s opinion of the instrument will be worth having .\\'-- but , said i , i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me .--` oh ,\\' said he , ` wait half a minute , till i have finished my job ;\\'-- for , would you believe it , miss woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother \\' s spectacles .-- the rivet came out , you know , this morning .-- so very obliging !-- for my mother had no use of her spectacles -- could not put them on . and , by the bye , every body ought to have two pair of spectacles ; they should indeed . jane said so . i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know . at one time patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping . oh , said i , patty do not come with your bad news to me . here is the rivet of your mistress \\' s spectacles out . then the baked apples came home , mrs . wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the wallises , always -- i have heard some people say that mrs . wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them . and it cannot be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ? only three of us .-- besides dear jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it . i dare not let my mother know how little she eats -- so i say one thing and then i say another , and it passes off . but about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr . perry ; i happened to meet him in the street . not that i had any doubt before -- i have so often heard mr . woodhouse recommend a baked apple . i believe it is the only way that mr . woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome . we have apple - dumplings , however , very often . patty makes an excellent apple - dumpling . well , mrs . weston , you have prevailed , i hope , and these ladies will oblige us .\" emma would be \" very happy to wait on mrs . bates , & c .,\" and they did at last move out of the shop , with no farther delay from miss bates than , \" how do you do , mrs . ford ? i beg your pardon . i did not see you before . i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town . jane came back delighted yesterday . thank ye , the gloves do very well -- only a little too large about the wrist ; but jane is taking them in .\" \" what was i talking of ?\" said she , beginning again when they were all in the street . emma wondered on what , of all the medley , she would fix . \" i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of .-- oh ! my mother \\' s spectacles . so very obliging of mr . frank churchill ! ` oh !\\' said he , ` i do think i can fasten the rivet ; i like a job of this kind excessively .\\'-- which you know shewed him to be so very . . . . indeed i must say that , much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected , he very far exceeds any thing . . . . i do congratulate you , mrs . weston , most warmly . he seems every thing the fondest parent could . . . . ` oh !\\' said he , ` i can fasten the rivet . i like a job of that sort excessively .\\' i never shall forget his manner . and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ` oh !\\' said he directly , ` there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good , and these are the finest - looking home - baked apples i ever saw in my life .\\' that , you know , was so very . . . . and i am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment . indeed they are very delightful apples , and mrs . wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice , and mr . woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times -- but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it . the apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking , beyond a doubt ; all from donwell -- some of mr . knightley \\' s most liberal supply . he sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees -- i believe there is two of them . my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days . but i was really quite shocked the other day -- for mr . knightley called one morning , and jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock . ` i am sure you must be ,\\' said he , ` and i will send you another supply ; for i have a great many more than i can ever use . william larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year . i will send you some more , before they get good for nothing .\\' so i begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , i could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for jane ; and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and jane said the same . and when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me -- no , i should not say quarrelled , for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished i had made him believe we had a great many left . oh , said i , my dear , i did say as much as i could . however , the very same evening william larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and i was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose . william larkins is such an old acquaintance ! i am always glad to see him . but , however , i found afterwards from patty , that william said it was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil . william did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for william , you know , thinks more of his master \\' s profit than any thing ; but mrs . hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away . she could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple - tart this spring . he told patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for mrs . hodges _would_ be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder . and so patty told me , and i was excessively shocked indeed ! i would not have mr . knightley know any thing about it for the world ! he would be so very . . . . i wanted to keep it from jane \\' s knowledge ; but , unluckily , i had mentioned it before i was aware .\" miss bates had just done as patty opened the door ; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to , pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good - will . \" pray take care , mrs . weston , there is a step at the turning . pray take care , miss woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase -- rather darker and narrower than one could wish . miss smith , pray take care . miss woodhouse , i am quite concerned , i am sure you hit your foot . miss smith , the step at the turning .\" chapter x the appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; mrs . bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , frank churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and jane fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her pianoforte . busy as he was , however , the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing emma again . \" this is a pleasure ,\" said he , in rather a low voice , \" coming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated . you find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think i shall succeed .\" \" what !\" said mrs . weston , \" have not you finished it yet ? you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate .\" \" i have not been working uninterruptedly ,\" he replied , \" i have been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , i believe . you see we have been wedging one leg with paper . this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come . i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home .\" he contrived that she should be seated by him ; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her , and trying to make her help or advise him in his work , till jane fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again . that she was not immediately ready , emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves ; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of performance ; and emma could not but pity such feelings , whatever their origin , and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again . at last jane began , and though the first bars were feebly given , the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to . mrs . weston had been delighted before , and was delighted again ; emma joined her in all her praise ; and the pianoforte , with every proper discrimination , was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise . \" whoever colonel campbell might employ ,\" said frank churchill , with a smile at emma , \" the person has not chosen ill . i heard a good deal of colonel campbell \\' s taste at weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would particularly prize . i dare say , miss fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to broadwood himself . do not you think so ?\" jane did not look round . she was not obliged to hear . mrs . weston had been speaking to her at the same moment . \" it is not fair ,\" said emma , in a whisper ; \" mine was a random guess . do not distress her .\" he shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy . soon afterwards he began again , \" how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion , miss fairfax . i dare say they often think of you , and wonder which will be the day , the precise day of the instrument \\' s coming to hand . do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time ?-- do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ?\" he paused . she could not but hear ; she could not avoid answering , \" till i have a letter from colonel campbell ,\" said she , in a voice of forced calmness , \" i can imagine nothing with any confidence . it must be all conjecture .\" \" conjecture -- aye , sometimes one conjectures right , and sometimes one conjectures wrong . i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this rivet quite firm . what nonsense one talks , miss woodhouse , when hard at work , if one talks at all ;-- your real workmen , i suppose , hold their tongues ; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word -- miss fairfax said something about conjecturing . there , it is done . i have the pleasure , madam , ( to mrs . bates ,) of restoring your spectacles , healed for the present .\" he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter ; to escape a little from the latter , he went to the pianoforte , and begged miss fairfax , who was still sitting at it , to play something more . \" if you are very kind ,\" said he , \" it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night ;-- let me live them over again . you did not enjoy them as i did ; you appeared tired the whole time . i believe you were glad we danced no longer ; but i would have given worlds -- all the worlds one ever has to give -- for another half - hour .\" she played . \" what felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one happy !-- if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth .\" she looked up at him for a moment , coloured deeply , and played something else . he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte , and turning to emma , said , \" here is something quite new to me . do you know it ?-- cramer .-- and here are a new set of irish melodies . that , from such a quarter , one might expect . this was all sent with the instrument . very thoughtful of colonel campbell , was not it ?-- he knew miss fairfax could have no music here . i honour that part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart . nothing hastily done ; nothing incomplete . true affection only could have prompted it .\" emma wished he would be less pointed , yet could not help being amused ; and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught the remains of a smile , when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness , there had been a smile of secret delight , she had less scruple in the amusement , and much less compunction with respect to her .-- this amiable , upright , perfect jane fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings . he brought all the music to her , and they looked it over together .-- emma took the opportunity of whispering , \" you speak too plain . she must understand you .\" \" i hope she does . i would have her understand me . i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning .\" \" but really , i am half ashamed , and wish i had never taken up the idea .\" \" i am very glad you did , and that you communicated it to me . i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways . leave shame to her . if she does wrong , she ought to feel it .\" \" she is not entirely without it , i think .\" \" i do not see much sign of it . she is playing _robin_ _adair_ at this moment -- _his_ favourite .\" shortly afterwards miss bates , passing near the window , descried mr . knightley on horse - back not far off . \" mr . knightley i declare !-- i must speak to him if possible , just to thank him . i will not open the window here ; it would give you all cold ; but i can go into my mother \\' s room you know . i dare say he will come in when he knows who is here . quite delightful to have you all meet so !-- our little room so honoured !\" she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke , and opening the casement there , immediately called mr . knightley \\' s attention , and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others , as if it had passed within the same apartment . \" how d \\' ye do ?-- how d \\' ye do ?-- very well , i thank you . so obliged to you for the carriage last night . we were just in time ; my mother just ready for us . pray come in ; do come in . you will find some friends here .\" so began miss bates ; and mr . knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn , for most resolutely and commandingly did he say , \" how is your niece , miss bates ?-- i want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece . how is miss fairfax ?-- i hope she caught no cold last night . how is she to - day ? tell me how miss fairfax is .\" and miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else . the listeners were amused ; and mrs . weston gave emma a look of particular meaning . but emma still shook her head in steady scepticism . \" so obliged to you !-- so very much obliged to you for the carriage ,\" resumed miss bates . he cut her short with , \" i am going to kingston . can i do any thing for you ?\" \" oh ! dear , kingston -- are you ?-- mrs . cole was saying the other day she wanted something from kingston .\" \" mrs . cole has servants to send . can i do any thing for _you_ ?\" \" no , i thank you . but do come in . who do you think is here ?-- miss woodhouse and miss smith ; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte . do put up your horse at the crown , and come in .\" \" well ,\" said he , in a deliberating manner , \" for five minutes , perhaps .\" \" and here is mrs . weston and mr . frank churchill too !-- quite delightful ; so many friends !\" \" no , not now , i thank you . i could not stay two minutes . i must get on to kingston as fast as i can .\" \" oh ! do come in . they will be so very happy to see you .\" \" no , no ; your room is full enough . i will call another day , and hear the pianoforte .\" \" well , i am so sorry !-- oh ! mr . knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant .-- did you ever see such dancing ?-- was not it delightful ?-- miss woodhouse and mr . frank churchill ; i never saw any thing equal to it .\" \" oh ! very delightful indeed ; i can say nothing less , for i suppose miss woodhouse and mr . frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes . and ( raising his voice still more ) i do not see why miss fairfax should not be mentioned too . i think miss fairfax dances very well ; and mrs . weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in england . now , if your friends have any gratitude , they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return ; but i cannot stay to hear it .\" \" oh ! mr . knightley , one moment more ; something of consequence -- so shocked !-- jane and i are both so shocked about the apples !\" \" what is the matter now ?\" \" to think of your sending us all your store apples . you said you had a great many , and now you have not one left . we really are so shocked ! mrs . hodges may well be angry . william larkins mentioned it here . you should not have done it , indeed you should not . ah ! he is off . he never can bear to be thanked . but i thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned . . . . well , ( returning to the room ,) i have not been able to succeed . mr . knightley cannot stop . he is going to kingston . he asked me if he could do any thing . . . .\" \" yes ,\" said jane , \" we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing .\" \" oh ! yes , my dear , i dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and mr . knightley spoke loud . you must have heard every thing to be sure . ` can i do any thing for you at kingston ?\\' said he ; so i just mentioned . . . . oh ! miss woodhouse , must you be going ?-- you seem but just come -- so very obliging of you .\" emma found it really time to be at home ; the visit had already lasted long ; and on examining watches , so much of the morning was perceived to be gone , that mrs . weston and her companion taking leave also , could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield gates , before they set off for randalls . chapter xi it may be possible to do without dancing entirely . instances have been known of young people passing many , many months successively , without being at any ball of any description , and no material injury accrue either to body or mind ;-- but when a beginning is made -- when the felicities of rapid motion have once been , though slightly , felt -- it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more . frank churchill had danced once at highbury , and longed to dance again ; and the last half - hour of an evening which mr . woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at randalls , was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject . frank \\' s was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance . but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr . frank churchill and miss woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that mr . weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest . his first proposition and request , that the dance begun at mr . cole \\' s should be finished there -- that the same party should be collected , and the same musician engaged , met with the readiest acquiescence . mr . weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment , and mrs . weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance ; and the interesting employment had followed , of reckoning up exactly who there would be , and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple . \" you and miss smith , and miss fairfax , will be three , and the two miss coxes five ,\" had been repeated many times over . \" and there will be the two gilberts , young cox , my father , and myself , besides mr . knightley . yes , that will be quite enough for pleasure . you and miss smith , and miss fairfax , will be three , and the two miss coxes five ; and for five couple there will be plenty of room .\" but soon it came to be on one side , \" but will there be good room for five couple ?-- i really do not think there will .\" on another , \" and after all , five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up . five couple are nothing , when one thinks seriously about it . it will not do to _invite_ five couple . it can be allowable only as the thought of the moment .\" somebody said that _miss_ gilbert was expected at her brother \\' s , and must be invited with the rest . somebody else believed _mrs_ . gilbert would have danced the other evening , if she had been asked . a word was put in for a second young cox ; and at last , mr . weston naming one family of cousins who must be included , and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out , it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten , and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of . the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other . \" might not they use both rooms , and dance across the passage ?\" it seemed the best scheme ; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better . emma said it would be awkward ; mrs . weston was in distress about the supper ; and mr . woodhouse opposed it earnestly , on the score of health . it made him so very unhappy , indeed , that it could not be persevered in . \" oh ! no ,\" said he ; \" it would be the extreme of imprudence . i could not bear it for emma !-- emma is not strong . she would catch a dreadful cold . so would poor little harriet . so you would all . mrs . weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing . pray do not let them talk of it . that young man ( speaking lower ) is very thoughtless . do not tell his father , but that young man is not quite the thing . he has been opening the doors very often this evening , and keeping them open very inconsiderately . he does not think of the draught . i do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing !\" mrs . weston was sorry for such a charge . she knew the importance of it , and said every thing in her power to do it away . every door was now closed , the passage plan given up , and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again ; and with such good - will on frank churchill \\' s part , that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple , was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten . \" we were too magnificent ,\" said he . \" we allowed unnecessary room . ten couple may stand here very well .\" emma demurred . \" it would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ?\" \" very true ,\" he gravely replied ; \" it was very bad .\" but still he went on measuring , and still he ended with , \" i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple .\" \" no , no ,\" said she , \" you are quite unreasonable . it would be dreadful to be standing so close ! nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd -- and a crowd in a little room !\" \" there is no denying it ,\" he replied . \" i agree with you exactly . a crowd in a little room -- miss woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words . exquisite , quite exquisite !-- still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up . it would be a disappointment to my father -- and altogether -- i do not know that -- i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well .\" emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self - willed , and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her ; but she took the compliment , and forgave the rest . had she intended ever to _marry_ him , it might have been worth while to pause and consider , and try to understand the value of his preference , and the character of his temper ; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance , he was quite amiable enough . before the middle of the next day , he was at hartfield ; and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme . it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement . \" well , miss woodhouse ,\" he almost immediately began , \" your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away , i hope , by the terrors of my father \\' s little rooms . i bring a new proposal on the subject :-- a thought of my father \\' s , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon . may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at randalls , but at the crown inn ?\" \" the crown !\" \" yes ; if you and mr . woodhouse see no objection , and i trust you cannot , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there . better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at randalls . it is his own idea . mrs . weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied . this is what we all feel . oh ! you were perfectly right ! ten couple , in either of the randalls rooms , would have been insufferable !-- dreadful !-- i felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_ to like to yield . is not it a good exchange ?-- you consent -- i hope you consent ?\" \" it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if mr . and mrs . weston do not . i think it admirable ; and , as far as i can answer for myself , shall be most happy -- it seems the only improvement that could be . papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ?\" she was obliged to repeat and explain it , before it was fully comprehended ; and then , being quite new , farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable . \" no ; he thought it very far from an improvement -- a very bad plan -- much worse than the other . a room at an inn was always damp and dangerous ; never properly aired , or fit to be inhabited . if they must dance , they had better dance at randalls . he had never been in the room at the crown in his life -- did not know the people who kept it by sight .-- oh ! no -- a very bad plan . they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere .\" \" i was going to observe , sir ,\" said frank churchill , \" that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body \\' s catching cold -- so much less danger at the crown than at randalls ! mr . perry might have reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could .\" \" sir ,\" said mr . woodhouse , rather warmly , \" you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr . perry to be that sort of character . mr . perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill . but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your father \\' s house .\" \" from the very circumstance of its being larger , sir . we shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief .\" \" open the windows !-- but surely , mr . churchill , nobody would think of opening the windows at randalls . nobody could be so imprudent ! i never heard of such a thing . dancing with open windows !-- i am sure , neither your father nor mrs . weston ( poor miss taylor that was ) would suffer it .\" \" ah ! sir -- but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected . i have often known it done myself .\" \" have you indeed , sir ?-- bless me ! i never could have supposed it . but i live out of the world , and am often astonished at what i hear . however , this does make a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come to talk it over -- but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration . one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry . if mr . and mrs . weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done .\" \" but , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited --\" \" oh !\" interrupted emma , \" there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over . there is no hurry at all . if it can be contrived to be at the crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses . they will be so near their own stable .\" \" so they will , my dear . that is a great thing . not that james ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can . if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired -- but is mrs . stokes to be trusted ? i doubt it . i do not know her , even by sight .\" \" i can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under mrs . weston \\' s care . mrs . weston undertakes to direct the whole .\" \" there , papa !-- now you must be satisfied -- our own dear mrs . weston , who is carefulness itself . do not you remember what mr . perry said , so many years ago , when i had the measles ? ` if _miss_ _taylor_ undertakes to wrap miss emma up , you need not have any fears , sir .\\' how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her !\" \" aye , very true . mr . perry did say so . i shall never forget it . poor little emma ! you were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for perry \\' s great attention . he came four times a day for a week . he said , from the first , it was a very good sort -- which was our great comfort ; but the measles are a dreadful complaint . i hope whenever poor isabella \\' s little ones have the measles , she will send for perry .\" \" my father and mrs . weston are at the crown at this moment ,\" said frank churchill , \" examining the capabilities of the house . i left them there and came on to hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot . i was desired to say so from both . it would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there . they can do nothing satisfactorily without you .\" emma was most happy to be called to such a council ; and her father , engaging to think it all over while she was gone , the two young people set off together without delay for the crown . there were mr . and mrs . weston ; delighted to see her and receive her approbation , very busy and very happy in their different way ; she , in some little distress ; and he , finding every thing perfect . \" emma ,\" said she , \" this paper is worse than i expected . look ! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined .\" \" my dear , you are too particular ,\" said her husband . \" what does all that signify ? you will see nothing of it by candlelight . it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight . we never see any thing of it on our club - nights .\" the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant , \" men never know when things are dirty or not ;\" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself , \" women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares .\" one perplexity , however , arose , which the gentlemen did not disdain . it regarded a supper - room . at the time of the ballroom \\' s being built , suppers had not been in question ; and a small card - room adjoining , was the only addition . what was to be done ? this card - room would be wanted as a card - room now ; or , if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves , still was it not too small for any comfortable supper ? another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose ; but it was at the other end of the house , and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it . this made a difficulty . mrs . weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage ; and neither emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper . mrs . weston proposed having no regular supper ; merely sandwiches , & c ., set out in the little room ; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion . a private dance , without sitting down to supper , was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women ; and mrs . weston must not speak of it again . she then took another line of expediency , and looking into the doubtful room , observed , \" i do not think it _is_ so very small . we shall not be many , you know .\" and mr . weston at the same time , walking briskly with long steps through the passage , was calling out , \" you talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear . it is a mere nothing after all ; and not the least draught from the stairs .\" \" i wish ,\" said mrs . weston , \" one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best . to do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object -- if one could but tell what that would be .\" \" yes , very true ,\" cried frank , \" very true . you want your neighbours \\' opinions . i do not wonder at you . if one could ascertain what the chief of them -- the coles , for instance . they are not far off . shall i call upon them ? or miss bates ? she is still nearer .-- and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body . i think we do want a larger council . suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us ?\" \" well -- if you please ,\" said mrs . weston rather hesitating , \" if you think she will be of any use .\" \" you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates ,\" said emma . \" she will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing . she will not even listen to your questions . i see no advantage in consulting miss bates .\" \" but she is so amusing , so extremely amusing ! i am very fond of hearing miss bates talk . and i need not bring the whole family , you know .\" here mr . weston joined them , and on hearing what was proposed , gave it his decided approbation . \" aye , do , frank .-- go and fetch miss bates , and let us end the matter at once . she will enjoy the scheme , i am sure ; and i do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties . fetch miss bates . we are growing a little too nice . she is a standing lesson of how to be happy . but fetch them both . invite them both .\" \" both sir ! can the old lady ?\" . . . \" the old lady ! no , the young lady , to be sure . i shall think you a great blockhead , frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece .\" \" oh ! i beg your pardon , sir . i did not immediately recollect . undoubtedly if you wish it , i will endeavour to persuade them both .\" and away he ran . long before he reappeared , attending the short , neat , brisk - moving aunt , and her elegant niece ,-- mrs . weston , like a sweet - tempered woman and a good wife , had examined the passage again , and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before -- indeed very trifling ; and here ended the difficulties of decision . all the rest , in speculation at least , was perfectly smooth . all the minor arrangements of table and chair , lights and music , tea and supper , made themselves ; or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between mrs . weston and mrs . stokes .-- every body invited , was certainly to come ; frank had already written to enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight , which could not possibly be refused . and a delightful dance it was to be . most cordially , when miss bates arrived , did she agree that it must . as a counsellor she was not wanted ; but as an approver , ( a much safer character ,) she was truly welcome . her approbation , at once general and minute , warm and incessant , could not but please ; and for another half - hour they were all walking to and fro , between the different rooms , some suggesting , some attending , and all in happy enjoyment of the future . the party did not break up without emma \\' s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening , nor without her overhearing mr . weston whisper to his wife , \" he has asked her , my dear . that \\' s right . i knew he would !\" chapter xii one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to emma -- its being fixed for a day within the granted term of frank churchill \\' s stay in surry ; for , in spite of mr . weston \\' s confidence , she could not think it so very impossible that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight . but this was not judged feasible . the preparations must take their time , nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on , and for a few days they must be planning , proceeding and hoping in uncertainty -- at the risk -- in her opinion , the great risk , of its being all in vain . enscombe however was gracious , gracious in fact , if not in word . his wish of staying longer evidently did not please ; but it was not opposed . all was safe and prosperous ; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another , emma , being now certain of her ball , began to adopt as the next vexation mr . knightley \\' s provoking indifference about it . either because he did not dance himself , or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted , he seemed resolved that it should not interest him , determined against its exciting any present curiosity , or affording him any future amusement . to her voluntary communications emma could get no more approving reply , than , \" very well . if the westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , i have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me .-- oh ! yes , i must be there ; i could not refuse ; and i will keep as much awake as i can ; but i would rather be at home , looking over william larkins \\' s week \\' s account ; much rather , i confess .-- pleasure in seeing dancing !-- not i , indeed -- i never look at it -- i do not know who does .-- fine dancing , i believe , like virtue , must be its own reward . those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different .\" this emma felt was aimed at her ; and it made her quite angry . it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was so indifferent , or so indignant ; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball , for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree . it made her animated -- open hearted -- she voluntarily said ;-- \" oh ! miss woodhouse , i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball . what a disappointment it would be ! i do look forward to it , i own , with _very_ great pleasure .\" it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of william larkins . no !-- she was more and more convinced that mrs . weston was quite mistaken in that surmise . there was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side -- but no love . alas ! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr . knightley . two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over - throw of every thing . a letter arrived from mr . churchill to urge his nephew \\' s instant return . mrs . churchill was unwell -- far too unwell to do without him ; she had been in a very suffering state ( so said her husband ) when writing to her nephew two days before , though from her usual unwillingness to give pain , and constant habit of never thinking of herself , she had not mentioned it ; but now she was too ill to trifle , and must entreat him to set off for enscombe without delay . the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma , in a note from mrs . weston , instantly . as to his going , it was inevitable . he must be gone within a few hours , though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt , to lessen his repugnance . he knew her illnesses ; they never occurred but for her own convenience . mrs . weston added , \" that he could only allow himself time to hurry to highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at hartfield very soon .\" this wretched note was the finale of emma \\' s breakfast . when once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim . the loss of the ball -- the loss of the young man -- and all that the young man might be feeling !-- it was too wretched !-- such a delightful evening as it would have been !-- every body so happy ! and she and her partner the happiest !--\" i said it would be so ,\" was the only consolation . her father \\' s feelings were quite distinct . he thought principally of mrs . churchill \\' s illness , and wanted to know how she was treated ; and as for the ball , it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed ; but they would all be safer at home . emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared ; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience , his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him . he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it . his dejection was most evident . he sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes ; and when rousing himself , it was only to say , \" of all horrid things , leave - taking is the worst .\" \" but you will come again ,\" said emma . \" this will not be your only visit to randalls .\" \" ah !--( shaking his head )-- the uncertainty of when i may be able to return !-- i shall try for it with a zeal !-- it will be the object of all my thoughts and cares !-- and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring -- but i am afraid -- they did not stir last spring -- i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever .\" \" our poor ball must be quite given up .\" \" ah ! that ball !-- why did we wait for any thing ?-- why not seize the pleasure at once ?-- how often is happiness destroyed by preparation , foolish preparation !-- you told us it would be so .-- oh ! miss woodhouse , why are you always so right ?\" \" indeed , i am very sorry to be right in this instance . i would much rather have been merry than wise .\" \" if i can come again , we are still to have our ball . my father depends on it . do not forget your engagement .\" emma looked graciously . \" such a fortnight as it has been !\" he continued ; \" every day more precious and more delightful than the day before !-- every day making me less fit to bear any other place . happy those , who can remain at highbury !\" \" as you do us such ample justice now ,\" said emma , laughing , \" i will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ? do not we rather surpass your expectations ? i am sure we do . i am sure you did not much expect to like us . you would not have been so long in coming , if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury .\" he laughed rather consciously ; and though denying the sentiment , emma was convinced that it had been so . \" and you must be off this very morning ?\" \" yes ; my father is to join me here : we shall walk back together , and i must be off immediately . i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him .\" \" not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss bates ? how unlucky ! miss bates \\' s powerful , argumentative mind might have strengthened yours .\" \" yes -- i _have_ called there ; passing the door , i thought it better . it was a right thing to do . i went in for three minutes , and was detained by miss bates \\' s being absent . she was out ; and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in . she is a woman that one may , that one _must_ laugh at ; but that one would not wish to slight . it was better to pay my visit , then \"-- he hesitated , got up , walked to a window . \" in short ,\" said he , \" perhaps , miss woodhouse -- i think you can hardly be quite without suspicion \"-- he looked at her , as if wanting to read her thoughts . she hardly knew what to say . it seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious , which she did not wish . forcing herself to speak , therefore , in the hope of putting it by , she calmly said , \" you are quite in the right ; it was most natural to pay your visit , then \"-- he was silent . she believed he was looking at her ; probably reflecting on what she had said , and trying to understand the manner . she heard him sigh . it was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh . he could not believe her to be encouraging him . a few awkward moments passed , and he sat down again ; and in a more determined manner said , \" it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to hartfield . my regard for hartfield is most warm \"-- he stopt again , rose again , and seemed quite embarrassed .-- he was more in love with her than emma had supposed ; and who can say how it might have ended , if his father had not made his appearance ? mr . woodhouse soon followed ; and the necessity of exertion made him composed . a very few minutes more , however , completed the present trial . mr . weston , always alert when business was to be done , and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable , as of foreseeing any that was doubtful , said , \" it was time to go ;\" and the young man , though he might and did sigh , could not but agree , to take leave . \" i shall hear about you all ,\" said he ; \" that is my chief consolation . i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you . i have engaged mrs . weston to correspond with me . she has been so kind as to promise it . oh ! the blessing of a female correspondent , when one is really interested in the absent !-- she will tell me every thing . in her letters i shall be at dear highbury again .\" a very friendly shake of the hand , a very earnest \" good - bye ,\" closed the speech , and the door had soon shut out frank churchill . short had been the notice -- short their meeting ; he was gone ; and emma felt so sorry to part , and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry , and feeling it too much . it was a sad change . they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival . certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks -- indescribable spirit ; the idea , the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought , the assurance of his attentions , his liveliness , his manners ! it had been a very happy fortnight , and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of hartfield days . to complete every other recommendation , he had _almost_ told her that he loved her . what strength , or what constancy of affection he might be subject to , was another point ; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration , a conscious preference of herself ; and this persuasion , joined to all the rest , made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him , in spite of every previous determination against it . \" i certainly must ,\" said she . \" this sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing \\' s being dull and insipid about the house !-- i must be in love ; i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not -- for a few weeks at least . well ! evil to some is always good to others . i shall have many fellow - mourners for the ball , if not for frank churchill ; but mr . knightley will be happy . he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes .\" mr . knightley , however , shewed no triumphant happiness . he could not say that he was sorry on his own account ; his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had ; but he said , and very steadily , that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others , and with considerable kindness added , \" you , emma , who have so few opportunities of dancing , you are really out of luck ; you are very much out of luck !\" it was some days before she saw jane fairfax , to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change ; but when they did meet , her composure was odious . she had been particularly unwell , however , suffering from headache to a degree , which made her aunt declare , that had the ball taken place , she did not think jane could have attended it ; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill - health . chapter xiii emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love . her ideas only varied as to the how much . at first , she thought it was a good deal ; and afterwards , but little . she had great pleasure in hearing frank churchill talked of ; and , for his sake , greater pleasure than ever in seeing mr . and mrs . weston ; she was very often thinking of him , and quite impatient for a letter , that she might know how he was , how were his spirits , how was his aunt , and what was the chance of his coming to randalls again this spring . but , on the other hand , she could not admit herself to be unhappy , nor , after the first morning , to be less disposed for employment than usual ; she was still busy and cheerful ; and , pleasing as he was , she could yet imagine him to have faults ; and farther , though thinking of him so much , and , as she sat drawing or working , forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment , fancying interesting dialogues , and inventing elegant letters ; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she _refused_ _him_ . their affection was always to subside into friendship . every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting ; but still they were to part . when she became sensible of this , it struck her that she could not be very much in love ; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father , never to marry , a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings . \" i do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_ ,\" said she .-- \" in not one of all my clever replies , my delicate negatives , is there any allusion to making a sacrifice . i do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness . so much the better . i certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do . i am quite enough in love . i should be sorry to be more .\" upon the whole , she was equally contented with her view of his feelings . \" _he_ is undoubtedly very much in love -- every thing denotes it -- very much in love indeed !-- and when he comes again , if his affection continue , i must be on my guard not to encourage it .-- it would be most inexcusable to do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made up . not that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto . no , if he had believed me at all to share his feelings , he would not have been so wretched . could he have thought himself encouraged , his looks and language at parting would have been different .-- still , however , i must be on my guard . this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but i do not know that i expect it will ; i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man -- i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy .-- his feelings are warm , but i can imagine them rather changeable .-- every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved .-- i shall do very well again after a little while -- and then , it will be a good thing over ; for they say every body is in love once in their lives , and i shall have been let off easily .\" when his letter to mrs . weston arrived , emma had the perusal of it ; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations , and think she had undervalued their strength . it was a long , well - written letter , giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings , expressing all the affection , gratitude , and respect which was natural and honourable , and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive , with spirit and precision . no suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern ; it was the language of real feeling towards mrs . weston ; and the transition from highbury to enscombe , the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt , and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety .-- the charm of her own name was not wanting . _miss_ _woodhouse_ appeared more than once , and never without a something of pleasing connexion , either a compliment to her taste , or a remembrance of what she had said ; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye , unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry , she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed . compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words --\" i had not a spare moment on tuesday , as you know , for miss woodhouse \\' s beautiful little friend . pray make my excuses and adieus to her .\" this , emma could not doubt , was all for herself . harriet was remembered only from being _her_ friend . his information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated ; mrs . churchill was recovering , and he dared not yet , even in his own imagination , fix a time for coming to randalls again . gratifying , however , and stimulative as was the letter in the material part , its sentiments , she yet found , when it was folded up and returned to mrs . weston , that it had not added any lasting warmth , that she could still do without the writer , and that he must learn to do without her . her intentions were unchanged . her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness . his recollection of harriet , and the words which clothed it , the \" beautiful little friend ,\" suggested to her the idea of harriet \\' s succeeding her in his affections . was it impossible ?-- no .-- harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding ; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner ; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour .-- for harriet , it would be advantageous and delightful indeed . \" i must not dwell upon it ,\" said she .--\" i must not think of it . i know the danger of indulging such speculations . but stranger things have happened ; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now , it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward to with pleasure .\" it was well to have a comfort in store on harriet \\' s behalf , though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom ; for evil in that quarter was at hand . as frank churchill \\' s arrival had succeeded mr . elton \\' s engagement in the conversation of highbury , as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first , so now upon frank churchill \\' s disappearance , mr . elton \\' s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form .-- his wedding - day was named . he would soon be among them again ; mr . elton and his bride . there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe before \" mr . elton and his bride \" was in every body \\' s mouth , and frank churchill was forgotten . emma grew sick at the sound . she had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr . elton ; and harriet \\' s mind , she had been willing to hope , had been lately gaining strength . with mr . weston \\' s ball in view at least , there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things ; but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach -- new carriage , bell - ringing , and all . poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma could give . emma felt that she could not do too much for her , that harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience ; but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect , for ever agreed to , without being able to make their opinions the same . harriet listened submissively , and said \" it was very true -- it was just as miss woodhouse described -- it was not worth while to think about them -- and she would not think about them any longer \" but no change of subject could avail , and the next half - hour saw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as before . at last emma attacked her on another ground . \" your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr . elton \\' s marrying , harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _me_ . you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into . it was all my doing , i know . i have not forgotten it , i assure you .-- deceived myself , i did very miserably deceive you -- and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever . do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it .\" harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation . emma continued , \" i have not said , exert yourself harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of mr . elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , i would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity . these are the motives which i have been pressing on you . they are very important -- and sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them . my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration . i want you to save yourself from greater pain . perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me .\" this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest . the idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse , whom she really loved extremely , made her wretched for a while , and when the violence of grief was comforted away , still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably . \" you , who have been the best friend i ever had in my life -- want gratitude to you !-- nobody is equal to you !-- i care for nobody as i do for you !-- oh ! miss woodhouse , how ungrateful i have been !\" such expressions , assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do , made emma feel that she had never loved harriet so well , nor valued her affection so highly before . \" there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart ,\" said she afterwards to herself . \" there is nothing to be compared to it . warmth and tenderness of heart , with an affectionate , open manner , will beat all the clearness of head in the world , for attraction , i am sure it will . it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved -- which gives isabella all her popularity .-- i have it not -- but i know how to prize and respect it .-- harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives . dear harriet !-- i would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing . oh ! the coldness of a jane fairfax !-- harriet is worth a hundred such -- and for a wife -- a sensible man \\' s wife -- it is invaluable . i mention no names ; but happy the man who changes emma for harriet !\" chapter xiv mrs . elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all . emma had feelings , less of curiosity than of pride or propriety , to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects ; and she made a point of harriet \\' s going with her , that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible . she could not enter the house again , could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago , to lace up her boot , without _recollecting_ . a thousand vexatious thoughts would recur . compliments , charades , and horrible blunders ; and it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be recollecting too ; but she behaved very well , and was only rather pale and silent . the visit was of course short ; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it , that emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady , and on no account to give one , beyond the nothing - meaning terms of being \" elegantly dressed , and very pleasing .\" she did not really like her . she would not be in a hurry to find fault , but she suspected that there was no elegance ;-- ease , but not elegance .-- she was almost sure that for a young woman , a stranger , a bride , there was too much ease . her person was rather good ; her face not unpretty ; but neither feature , nor air , nor voice , nor manner , were elegant . emma thought at least it would turn out so . as for mr . elton , his manners did not appear -- but no , she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners . it was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits , and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it . the woman was better off ; she might have the assistance of fine clothes , and the privilege of bashfulness , but the man had only his own good sense to depend on ; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor mr . elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married , the woman he had wanted to marry , and the woman whom he had been expected to marry , she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise , and to be as much affectedly , and as little really easy as could be . \" well , miss woodhouse ,\" said harriet , when they had quitted the house , and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin ; \" well , miss woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh ,) what do you think of her ?-- is not she very charming ?\" there was a little hesitation in emma \\' s answer . \" oh ! yes -- very -- a very pleasing young woman .\" \" i think her beautiful , quite beautiful .\" \" very nicely dressed , indeed ; a remarkably elegant gown .\" \" i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love .\" \" oh ! no -- there is nothing to surprize one at all .-- a pretty fortune ; and she came in his way .\" \" i dare say ,\" returned harriet , sighing again , \" i dare say she was very much attached to him .\" \" perhaps she might ; but it is not every man \\' s fate to marry the woman who loves him best . miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have .\" \" yes ,\" said harriet earnestly , \" and well she might , nobody could ever have a better . well , i wish them happy with all my heart . and now , miss woodhouse , i do not think i shall mind seeing them again . he is just as superior as ever ;-- but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing . no , indeed , miss woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; i can sit and admire him now without any great misery . to know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort !-- she does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves . happy creature ! he called her ` augusta .\\' how delightful !\" when the visit was returned , emma made up her mind . she could then see more and judge better . from harriet \\' s happening not to be at hartfield , and her father \\' s being present to engage mr . elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady \\' s conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that mrs . elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do mr . elton no good . harriet would have been a better match . if not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but miss hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set . the rich brother - in - law near bristol was the pride of the alliance , and his place and his carriages were the pride of him . the very first subject after being seated was maple grove , \" my brother mr . suckling \\' s seat ;\"-- a comparison of hartfield to maple grove . the grounds of hartfield were small , but neat and pretty ; and the house was modern and well - built . mrs . elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room , the entrance , and all that she could see or imagine . \" very like maple grove indeed !-- she was quite struck by the likeness !-- that room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at maple grove ; her sister \\' s favourite room .\"-- mr . elton was appealed to .--\" was not it astonishingly like ?-- she could really almost fancy herself at maple grove .\" \" and the staircase -- you know , as i came in , i observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly in the same part of the house . i really could not help exclaiming ! i assure you , miss woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to be reminded of a place i am so extremely partial to as maple grove . i have spent so many happy months there ! ( with a little sigh of sentiment ). a charming place , undoubtedly . every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home . whenever you are transplanted , like me , miss woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind . i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony .\" emma made as slight a reply as she could ; but it was fully sufficient for mrs . elton , who only wanted to be talking herself . \" so extremely like maple grove ! and it is not merely the house -- the grounds , i assure you , as far as i could observe , are strikingly like . the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here , and stand very much in the same way -- just across the lawn ; and i had a glimpse of a fine large tree , with a bench round it , which put me so exactly in mind ! my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place . people who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style .\" emma doubted the truth of this sentiment . she had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else ; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double - dyed , and therefore only said in reply , \" when you have seen more of this country , i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield . surry is full of beauties .\" \" oh ! yes , i am quite aware of that . it is the garden of england , you know . surry is the garden of england .\" \" yes ; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction . many counties , i believe , are called the garden of england , as well as surry .\" \" no , i fancy not ,\" replied mrs . elton , with a most satisfied smile .\" i never heard any county but surry called so .\" emma was silenced . \" my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring , or summer at farthest ,\" continued mrs . elton ; \" and that will be our time for exploring . while they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , i dare say . they will have their barouche - landau , of course , which holds four perfectly ; and therefore , without saying any thing of _our_ carriage , we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well . they would hardly come in their chaise , i think , at that season of the year . indeed , when the time draws on , i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche - landau ; it will be so very much preferable . when people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , miss woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and mr . suckling is extremely fond of exploring . we explored to king \\' s - weston twice last summer , in that way , most delightfully , just after their first having the barouche - landau . you have many parties of that kind here , i suppose , miss woodhouse , every summer ?\" \" no ; not immediately here . we are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , i believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure .\" \" ah ! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort . nobody can be more devoted to home than i am . i was quite a proverb for it at maple grove . many a time has selina said , when she has been going to bristol , ` i really cannot get this girl to move from the house . i absolutely must go in by myself , though i hate being stuck up in the barouche - landau without a companion ; but augusta , i believe , with her own good - will , would never stir beyond the park paling .\\' many a time has she said so ; and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion . i think , on the contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society , it is a very bad thing ; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree , without living in it either too much or too little . i perfectly understand your situation , however , miss woodhouse -- ( looking towards mr . woodhouse ), your father \\' s state of health must be a great drawback . why does not he try bath ?-- indeed he should . let me recommend bath to you . i assure you i have no doubt of its doing mr . woodhouse good .\" \" my father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and mr . perry , whose name , i dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now .\" \" ah ! that \\' s a great pity ; for i assure you , miss woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give . in my bath life , i have seen such instances of it ! and it is so cheerful a place , that it could not fail of being of use to mr . woodhouse \\' s spirits , which , i understand , are sometimes much depressed . and as to its recommendations to _you_ , i fancy i need not take much pains to dwell on them . the advantages of bath to the young are pretty generally understood . it would be a charming introduction for you , who have lived so secluded a life ; and i could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place . a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend , mrs . partridge , the lady i have always resided with when in bath , would be most happy to shew you any attentions , and would be the very person for you to go into public with .\" it was as much as emma could bear , without being impolite . the idea of her being indebted to mrs . elton for what was called an _introduction_ -- of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of mrs . elton \\' s -- probably some vulgar , dashing widow , who , with the help of a boarder , just made a shift to live !-- the dignity of miss woodhouse , of hartfield , was sunk indeed ! she restrained herself , however , from any of the reproofs she could have given , and only thanked mrs . elton coolly ; \" but their going to bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father .\" and then , to prevent farther outrage and indignation , changed the subject directly . \" i do not ask whether you are musical , mrs . elton . upon these occasions , a lady \\' s character generally precedes her ; and highbury has long known that you are a superior performer .\" \" oh ! no , indeed ; i must protest against any such idea . a superior performer !-- very far from it , i assure you . consider from how partial a quarter your information came . i am doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond ;-- and my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree . you , miss woodhouse , i well know , play delightfully . i assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society i am got into . i absolutely cannot do without music . it is a necessary of life to me ; and having always been used to a very musical society , both at maple grove and in bath , it would have been a most serious sacrifice . i honestly said as much to mr . e . when he was speaking of my future home , and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable ; and the inferiority of the house too -- knowing what i had been accustomed to -- of course he was not wholly without apprehension . when he was speaking of it in that way , i honestly said that _the_ _world_ i could give up -- parties , balls , plays -- for i had no fear of retirement . blessed with so many resources within myself , the world was not necessary to _me_ . i could do very well without it . to those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent . and as to smaller - sized rooms than i had been used to , i really could not give it a thought . i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description . certainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove ; but i did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness , nor were spacious apartments . ` but ,\\' said i , ` to be quite honest , i do not think i can live without something of a musical society . i condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me .\\'\" \" we cannot suppose ,\" said emma , smiling , \" that mr . elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in highbury ; and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the motive .\" \" no , indeed , i have no doubts at all on that head . i am delighted to find myself in such a circle . i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together . i think , miss woodhouse , you and i must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours . will not it be a good plan ? if _we_ exert ourselves , i think we shall not be long in want of allies . something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know -- there is a sad story against them , in general . they are but too apt to give up music .\" \" but you , who are so extremely fond of it -- there can be no danger , surely ?\" \" i should hope not ; but really when i look around among my acquaintance , i tremble . selina has entirely given up music -- never touches the instrument -- though she played sweetly . and the same may be said of mrs . jeffereys -- clara partridge , that was -- and of the two milmans , now mrs . bird and mrs . james cooper ; and of more than i can enumerate . upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright . i used to be quite angry with selina ; but really i begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention . i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper .\" \" but every thing of that kind ,\" said emma , \" will soon be in so regular a train --\" \" well ,\" said mrs . elton , laughing , \" we shall see .\" emma , finding her so determined upon neglecting her music , had nothing more to say ; and , after a moment \\' s pause , mrs . elton chose another subject . \" we have been calling at randalls ,\" said she , \" and found them both at home ; and very pleasant people they seem to be . i like them extremely . mr . weston seems an excellent creature -- quite a first - rate favourite with me already , i assure you . and _she_ appears so truly good -- there is something so motherly and kind - hearted about her , that it wins upon one directly . she was your governess , i think ?\" emma was almost too much astonished to answer ; but mrs . elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on . \" having understood as much , i was rather astonished to find her so very lady - like ! but she is really quite the gentlewoman .\" \" mrs . weston \\' s manners ,\" said emma , \" were always particularly good . their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman .\" \" and who do you think came in while we were there ?\" emma was quite at a loss . the tone implied some old acquaintance -- and how could she possibly guess ? \" knightley !\" continued mrs . elton ; \" knightley himself !-- was not it lucky ?-- for , not being within when he called the other day , i had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of mr . e .\\' s , i had a great curiosity . ` my friend knightley \\' had been so often mentioned , that i was really impatient to see him ; and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend . knightley is quite the gentleman . i like him very much . decidedly , i think , a very gentleman - like man .\" happily , it was now time to be gone . they were off ; and emma could breathe . \" insufferable woman !\" was her immediate exclamation . \" worse than i had supposed . absolutely insufferable ! knightley !-- i could not have believed it . knightley !-- never seen him in her life before , and call him knightley !-- and discover that he is a gentleman ! a little upstart , vulgar being , with her mr . e ., and her _caro_ _sposo_ , and her resources , and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery . actually to discover that mr . knightley is a gentleman ! i doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady . i could not have believed it ! and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club ! one would fancy we were bosom friends ! and mrs . weston !-- astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman ! worse and worse . i never met with her equal . much beyond my hopes . harriet is disgraced by any comparison . oh ! what would frank churchill say to her , if he were here ? how angry and how diverted he would be ! ah ! there i am -- thinking of him directly . always the first person to be thought of ! how i catch myself out ! frank churchill comes as regularly into my mind !\"-- all this ran so glibly through her thoughts , that by the time her father had arranged himself , after the bustle of the eltons \\' departure , and was ready to speak , she was very tolerably capable of attending . \" well , my dear ,\" he deliberately began , \" considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and i dare say she was very much pleased with you . she speaks a little too quick . a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear . but i believe i am nice ; i do not like strange voices ; and nobody speaks like you and poor miss taylor . however , she seems a very obliging , pretty - behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife . though i think he had better not have married . i made the best excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs . elton on this happy occasion ; i said that i hoped i _should_ in the course of the summer . but i ought to have gone before . not to wait upon a bride is very remiss . ah ! it shews what a sad invalid i am ! but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane .\" \" i dare say your apologies were accepted , sir . mr . elton knows you .\" \" yes : but a young lady -- a bride -- i ought to have paid my respects to her if possible . it was being very deficient .\" \" but , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_ ? it ought to be no recommendation to _you_ . it is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them .\" \" no , my dear , i never encouraged any body to marry , but i would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady -- and a bride , especially , is never to be neglected . more is avowedly due to _her_ . a bride , you know , my dear , is always the first in company , let the others be who they may .\" \" well , papa , if this is not encouragement to marry , i do not know what is . and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity - baits for poor young ladies .\" \" my dear , you do not understand me . this is a matter of mere common politeness and good - breeding , and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry .\" emma had done . her father was growing nervous , and could not understand _her_ . her mind returned to mrs . elton \\' s offences , and long , very long , did they occupy her . chapter xv emma was not required , by any subsequent discovery , to retract her ill opinion of mrs . elton . her observation had been pretty correct . such as mrs . elton appeared to her on this second interview , such she appeared whenever they met again ,-- self - important , presuming , familiar , ignorant , and ill - bred . she had a little beauty and a little accomplishment , but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world , to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood ; and conceived miss hawkins to have held such a place in society as mrs . elton \\' s consequence only could surpass . there was no reason to suppose mr . elton thought at all differently from his wife . he seemed not merely happy with her , but proud . he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highbury , as not even miss woodhouse could equal ; and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed to commend , or not in the habit of judging , following the lead of miss bates \\' s good - will , or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were very well satisfied ; so that mrs . elton \\' s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do , unimpeded by miss woodhouse , who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being \" very pleasant and very elegantly dressed .\" in one respect mrs . elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first . her feelings altered towards emma .-- offended , probably , by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with , she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant ; and though the effect was agreeable , the ill - will which produced it was necessarily increasing emma \\' s dislike . her manners , too -- and mr . elton \\' s , were unpleasant towards harriet . they were sneering and negligent . emma hoped it must rapidly work harriet \\' s cure ; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much .-- it was not to be doubted that poor harriet \\' s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve , and her own share in the story , under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him , had in all likelihood been given also . she was , of course , the object of their joint dislike .-- when they had nothing else to say , it must be always easy to begin abusing miss woodhouse ; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her , found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of harriet . mrs . elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax ; and from the first . not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other , but from the very first ; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration -- but without solicitation , or plea , or privilege , she must be wanting to assist and befriend her .-- before emma had forfeited her confidence , and about the third time of their meeting , she heard all mrs . elton \\' s knight - errantry on the subject .-- \" jane fairfax is absolutely charming , miss woodhouse .-- i quite rave about jane fairfax .-- a sweet , interesting creature . so mild and ladylike -- and with such talents !-- i assure you i think she has very extraordinary talents . i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well . i know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point . oh ! she is absolutely charming ! you will laugh at my warmth -- but , upon my word , i talk of nothing but jane fairfax .-- and her situation is so calculated to affect one !-- miss woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her . we must bring her forward . such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown .-- i dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet , ` full many a flower is born to blush unseen , ` and waste its fragrance on the desert air .\\' we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax .\" \" i cannot think there is any danger of it ,\" was emma \\' s calm answer -- \" and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfax \\' s situation and understand what her home has been , with colonel and mrs . campbell , i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown .\" \" oh ! but dear miss woodhouse , she is now in such retirement , such obscurity , so thrown away .-- whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end ! and i think she feels it . i am sure she does . she is very timid and silent . one can see that she feels the want of encouragement . i like her the better for it . i must confess it is a recommendation to me . i am a great advocate for timidity -- and i am sure one does not often meet with it .-- but in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing . oh ! i assure you , jane fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than i can express .\" \" you appear to feel a great deal -- but i am not aware how you or any of miss fairfax \\' s acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than \"-- \" my dear miss woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act . you and i need not be afraid . if _we_ set the example , many will follow it as far as they can ; though all have not our situations . _we_ have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and _we_ live in a style which could not make the addition of jane fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient .-- i should be extremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked _more_ than jane fairfax to partake of it . i have no idea of that sort of thing . it is not likely that i _should_ , considering what i have been used to . my greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense . maple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be -- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , mr . suckling , in income .-- however , my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax .-- i shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever i can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation . my acquaintance is so very extensive , that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly .-- i shall introduce her , of course , very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us . i am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating .-- i shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties .\" \" poor jane fairfax !\"-- thought emma .--\" you have not deserved this . you may have done wrong with regard to mr . dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited !-- the kindness and protection of mrs . elton !--` jane fairfax and jane fairfax .\\' heavens ! let me not suppose that she dares go about , emma woodhouse - ing me !-- but upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman \\' s tongue !\" emma had not to listen to such paradings again -- to any so exclusively addressed to herself -- so disgustingly decorated with a \" dear miss woodhouse .\" the change on mrs . elton \\' s side soon afterwards appeared , and she was left in peace -- neither forced to be the very particular friend of mrs . elton , nor , under mrs . elton \\' s guidance , the very active patroness of jane fairfax , and only sharing with others in a general way , in knowing what was felt , what was meditated , what was done . she looked on with some amusement .-- miss bates \\' s gratitude for mrs . elton \\' s attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth . she was quite one of her worthies -- the most amiable , affable , delightful woman -- just as accomplished and condescending as mrs . elton meant to be considered . emma \\' s only surprize was that jane fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate mrs . elton as she seemed to do . she heard of her walking with the eltons , sitting with the eltons , spending a day with the eltons ! this was astonishing !-- she could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of miss fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the vicarage had to offer . \" she is a riddle , quite a riddle !\" said she .--\" to chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort ! and now to chuse the mortification of mrs . elton \\' s notice and the penury of her conversation , rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real , generous affection .\" jane had come to highbury professedly for three months ; the campbells were gone to ireland for three months ; but now the campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer , and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there . according to miss bates -- it all came from her -- mrs . dixon had written most pressingly . would jane but go , means were to be found , servants sent , friends contrived -- no travelling difficulty allowed to exist ; but still she had declined it ! \" she must have some motive , more powerful than appears , for refusing this invitation ,\" was emma \\' s conclusion . \" she must be under some sort of penance , inflicted either by the campbells or herself . there is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere .-- she is _not_ to be with the _dixons_ . the decree is issued by somebody . but why must she consent to be with the eltons ?-- here is quite a separate puzzle .\" upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject , before the few who knew her opinion of mrs . elton , mrs . weston ventured this apology for jane . \" we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage , my dear emma -- but it is better than being always at home . her aunt is a good creature , but , as a constant companion , must be very tiresome . we must consider what miss fairfax quits , before we condemn her taste for what she goes to .\" \" you are right , mrs . weston ,\" said mr . knightley warmly , \" miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs . elton . could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her . but ( with a reproachful smile at emma ) she receives attentions from mrs . elton , which nobody else pays her .\" emma felt that mrs . weston was giving her a momentary glance ; and she was herself struck by his warmth . with a faint blush , she presently replied , \" such attentions as mrs . elton \\' s , i should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax . mrs . elton \\' s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting .\" \" i should not wonder ,\" said mrs . weston , \" if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt \\' s eagerness in accepting mrs . elton \\' s civilities for her . poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change .\" both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again ; and after a few minutes silence , he said , \" another thing must be taken into consideration too -- mrs . elton does not talk _to_ miss fairfax as she speaks _of_ her . we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other -- a something more early implanted . we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before . we feel things differently . and besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs . elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , mrs . elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to . such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs . elton \\' s way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness .\" \" i know how highly you think of jane fairfax ,\" said emma . little henry was in her thoughts , and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say . \" yes ,\" he replied , \" any body may know how highly i think of her .\" \" and yet ,\" said emma , beginning hastily and with an arch look , but soon stopping -- it was better , however , to know the worst at once -- she hurried on --\" and yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is . the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other .\" mr . knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters , and either the exertion of getting them together , or some other cause , brought the colour into his face , as he answered , \" oh ! are you there ?-- but you are miserably behindhand . mr . cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago .\" he stopped .-- emma felt her foot pressed by mrs . weston , and did not herself know what to think . in a moment he went on -- \" that will never be , however , i can assure you . miss fairfax , i dare say , would not have me if i were to ask her -- and i am very sure i shall never ask her .\" emma returned her friend \\' s pressure with interest ; and was pleased enough to exclaim , \" you are not vain , mr . knightley . i will say that for you .\" he seemed hardly to hear her ; he was thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not pleased , soon afterwards said , \" so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax ?\" \" no indeed i have not . you have scolded me too much for match - making , for me to presume to take such a liberty with you . what i said just now , meant nothing . one says those sort of things , of course , without any idea of a serious meaning . oh ! no , upon my word i have not the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body . you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married .\" mr . knightley was thoughtful again . the result of his reverie was , \" no , emma , i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize .-- i never had a thought of her in that way , i assure you .\" and soon afterwards , \" jane fairfax is a very charming young woman -- but not even jane fairfax is perfect . she has a fault . she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife .\" emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault . \" well ,\" said she , \" and you soon silenced mr . cole , i suppose ?\" \" yes , very soon . he gave me a quiet hint ; i told him he was mistaken ; he asked my pardon and said no more . cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours .\" \" in that respect how unlike dear mrs . elton , who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world ! i wonder how she speaks of the coles -- what she calls them ! how can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ? she calls you , knightley -- what can she do for mr . cole ? and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her . mrs . weston , your argument weighs most with me . i can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates , than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfax \\' s mind over mrs . elton . i have no faith in mrs . elton \\' s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding . i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau .\" \" jane fairfax has feeling ,\" said mr . knightley --\" i do not accuse her of want of feeling . her sensibilities , i suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness . she is reserved , more reserved , i think , than she used to be -- and i love an open temper . no -- till cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head . i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always -- but with no thought beyond .\" \" well , mrs . weston ,\" said emma triumphantly when he left them , \" what do you say now to mr . knightley \\' s marrying jane fairfax ?\" \" why , really , dear emma , i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _not_ being in love with her , that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last . do not beat me .\" chapter xvi every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr . elton , was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage . dinner - parties and evening - parties were made for him and his lady ; and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day . \" i see how it is ,\" said she . \" i see what a life i am to lead among you . upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated . we really seem quite the fashion . if this is living in the country , it is nothing very formidable . from monday next to saturday , i assure you we have not a disengaged day !-- a woman with fewer resources than i have , need not have been at a loss .\" no invitation came amiss to her . her bath habits made evening - parties perfectly natural to her , and maple grove had given her a taste for dinners . she was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms , at the poor attempt at rout - cakes , and there being no ice in the highbury card - parties . mrs . bates , mrs . perry , mrs . goddard and others , were a good deal behind - hand in knowledge of the world , but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged . in the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party -- in which her card - tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style -- and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish , to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour , and in the proper order . emma , in the meanwhile , could not be satisfied without a dinner at hartfield for the eltons . they must not do less than others , or she should be exposed to odious suspicions , and imagined capable of pitiful resentment . a dinner there must be . after emma had talked about it for ten minutes , mr . woodhouse felt no unwillingness , and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself , with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him . the persons to be invited , required little thought . besides the eltons , it must be the westons and mr . knightley ; so far it was all of course -- and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must be asked to make the eighth :-- but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction , and on many accounts emma was particularly pleased by harriet \\' s begging to be allowed to decline it . \" she would rather not be in his company more than she could help . she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable . if miss woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home .\" it was precisely what emma would have wished , had she deemed it possible enough for wishing . she was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend -- for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home ; and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth , jane fairfax .-- since her last conversation with mrs . weston and mr . knightley , she was more conscience - stricken about jane fairfax than she had often been .-- mr . knightley \\' s words dwelt with her . he had said that jane fairfax received attentions from mrs . elton which nobody else paid her . \" this is very true ,\" said she , \" at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful .-- of the same age -- and always knowing her -- i ought to have been more her friend .-- she will never like me now . i have neglected her too long . but i will shew her greater attention than i have done .\" every invitation was successful . they were all disengaged and all happy .-- the preparatory interest of this dinner , however , was not yet over . a circumstance rather unlucky occurred . the two eldest little knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring , and their papa now proposed bringing them , and staying one whole day at hartfield -- which one day would be the very day of this party .-- his professional engagements did not allow of his being put off , but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so . mr . woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear -- and here would be a ninth -- and emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to hartfield for forty - eight hours without falling in with a dinner - party . she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself , by representing that though he certainly would make them nine , yet he always said so little , that the increase of noise would be very immaterial . she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself , to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother . the event was more favourable to mr . woodhouse than to emma . john knightley came ; but mr . weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day . he might be able to join them in the evening , but certainly not to dinner . mr . woodhouse was quite at ease ; and the seeing him so , with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate , removed the chief of even emma \\' s vexation . the day came , the party were punctually assembled , and mr . john knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable . instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner , he was talking to miss fairfax . mrs . elton , as elegant as lace and pearls could make her , he looked at in silence -- wanting only to observe enough for isabella \\' s information -- but miss fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl , and he could talk to her . he had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys , when it had been just beginning to rain . it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject , and he said , \" i hope you did not venture far , miss fairfax , this morning , or i am sure you must have been wet .-- we scarcely got home in time . i hope you turned directly .\" \" i went only to the post - office ,\" said she , \" and reached home before the rain was much . it is my daily errand . i always fetch the letters when i am here . it saves trouble , and is a something to get me out . a walk before breakfast does me good .\" \" not a walk in the rain , i should imagine .\" \" no , but it did not absolutely rain when i set out .\" mr . john knightley smiled , and replied , \" that is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you ; and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before . the post - office has a great charm at one period of our lives . when you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for .\" there was a little blush , and then this answer , \" i must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore i cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters .\" \" indifferent ! oh ! no -- i never conceived you could become indifferent . letters are no matter of indifference ; they are generally a very positive curse .\" \" you are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship .\" \" i have often thought them the worst of the two ,\" replied he coolly . \" business , you know , may bring money , but friendship hardly ever does .\" \" ah ! you are not serious now . i know mr . john knightley too well -- i am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body . i can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation . you have every body dearest to you always at hand , i , probably , never shall again ; and therefore till i have outlived all my affections , a post - office , i think , must always have power to draw me out , in worse weather than to - day .\" \" when i talked of your being altered by time , by the progress of years ,\" said john knightley , \" i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings . i consider one as including the other . time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle -- but that is not the change i had in view for you . as an old friend , you will allow me to hope , miss fairfax , that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have .\" it was kindly said , and very far from giving offence . a pleasant \" thank you \" seemed meant to laugh it off , but a blush , a quivering lip , a tear in the eye , shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh . her attention was now claimed by mr . woodhouse , who being , according to his custom on such occasions , making the circle of his guests , and paying his particular compliments to the ladies , was ending with her -- and with all his mildest urbanity , said , \" i am very sorry to hear , miss fairfax , of your being out this morning in the rain . young ladies should take care of themselves .-- young ladies are delicate plants . they should take care of their health and their complexion . my dear , did you change your stockings ?\" \" yes , sir , i did indeed ; and i am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me .\" \" my dear miss fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for .-- i hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well . they are some of my very old friends . i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour . you do us a great deal of honour to - day , i am sure . my daughter and i are both highly sensible of your goodness , and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield .\" the kind - hearted , polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty , and made every fair lady welcome and easy . by this time , the walk in the rain had reached mrs . elton , and her remonstrances now opened upon jane . \" my dear jane , what is this i hear ?-- going to the post - office in the rain !-- this must not be , i assure you .-- you sad girl , how could you do such a thing ?-- it is a sign i was not there to take care of you .\" jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold . \" oh ! do not tell _me_ . you really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself .-- to the post - office indeed ! mrs . weston , did you ever hear the like ? you and i must positively exert our authority .\" \" my advice ,\" said mrs . weston kindly and persuasively , \" i certainly do feel tempted to give . miss fairfax , you must not run such risks .-- liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year . the spring i always think requires more than common care . better wait an hour or two , or even half a day for your letters , than run the risk of bringing on your cough again . now do not you feel that you had ? yes , i am sure you are much too reasonable . you look as if you would not do such a thing again .\" \" oh ! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again ,\" eagerly rejoined mrs . elton . \" we will not allow her to do such a thing again :\"-- and nodding significantly --\" there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed . i shall speak to mr . e . the man who fetches our letters every morning ( one of our men , i forget his name ) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you . that will obviate all difficulties you know ; and from _us_ i really think , my dear jane , you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation .\" \" you are extremely kind ,\" said jane ; \" but i cannot give up my early walk . i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can , i must walk somewhere , and the post - office is an object ; and upon my word , i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before .\" \" my dear jane , say no more about it . the thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as i can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master . you know , mrs . weston , you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves . but i do flatter myself , my dear jane , that my influence is not entirely worn out . if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled .\" \" excuse me ,\" said jane earnestly , \" i cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant . if the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when i am not here , by my grandmama \\' s .\" \" oh ! my dear ; but so much as patty has to do !-- and it is a kindness to employ our men .\" jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered ; but instead of answering , she began speaking again to mr . john knightley . \" the post - office is a wonderful establishment !\" said she .-- \" the regularity and despatch of it ! if one thinks of all that it has to do , and all that it does so well , it is really astonishing !\" \" it is certainly very well regulated .\" \" so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears ! so seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million , i suppose , actually lost ! and when one considers the variety of hands , and of bad hands too , that are to be deciphered , it increases the wonder .\" \" the clerks grow expert from habit .-- they must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them . if you want any farther explanation ,\" continued he , smiling , \" they are paid for it . that is the key to a great deal of capacity . the public pays and must be served well .\" the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of , and the usual observations made . \" i have heard it asserted ,\" said john knightley , \" that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the same master teaches , it is natural enough . but for that reason , i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females , for boys have very little teaching after an early age , and scramble into any hand they can get . isabella and emma , i think , do write very much alike . i have not always known their writing apart .\" \" yes ,\" said his brother hesitatingly , \" there is a likeness . i know what you mean -- but emma \\' s hand is the strongest .\" \" isabella and emma both write beautifully ,\" said mr . woodhouse ; \" and always did . and so does poor mrs . weston \"-- with half a sigh and half a smile at her . \" i never saw any gentleman \\' s handwriting \"-- emma began , looking also at mrs . weston ; but stopped , on perceiving that mrs . weston was attending to some one else -- and the pause gave her time to reflect , \" now , how am i going to introduce him ?-- am i unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ? is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase ?-- your yorkshire friend -- your correspondent in yorkshire ;-- that would be the way , i suppose , if i were very bad .-- no , i can pronounce his name without the smallest distress . i certainly get better and better .-- now for it .\" mrs . weston was disengaged and emma began again --\" mr . frank churchill writes one of the best gentleman \\' s hands i ever saw .\" \" i do not admire it ,\" said mr . knightley . \" it is too small -- wants strength . it is like a woman \\' s writing .\" this was not submitted to by either lady . they vindicated him against the base aspersion . \" no , it by no means wanted strength -- it was not a large hand , but very clear and certainly strong . had not mrs . weston any letter about her to produce ?\" no , she had heard from him very lately , but having answered the letter , had put it away . \" if we were in the other room ,\" said emma , \" if i had my writing - desk , i am sure i could produce a specimen . i have a note of his .-- do not you remember , mrs . weston , employing him to write for you one day ?\" \" he chose to say he was employed \"-- \" well , well , i have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince mr . knightley .\" \" oh ! when a gallant young man , like mr . frank churchill ,\" said mr . knightley dryly , \" writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best .\" dinner was on table .-- mrs . elton , before she could be spoken to , was ready ; and before mr . woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining - parlour , was saying -- \" must i go first ? i really am ashamed of always leading the way .\" jane \\' s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma . she had heard and seen it all ; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any . she suspected that it _had_ ; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear , and that it had not been in vain . she thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual -- a glow both of complexion and spirits . she could have made an inquiry or two , as to the expedition and the expense of the irish mails ;-- it was at her tongue \\' s end -- but she abstained . she was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt jane fairfax \\' s feelings ; and they followed the other ladies out of the room , arm in arm , with an appearance of good - will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each . chapter xvii when the ladies returned to the drawing - room after dinner , emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties ;-- with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs . elton engross jane fairfax and slight herself . she and mrs . weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together . mrs . elton left them no choice . if jane repressed her for a little time , she soon began again ; and though much that passed between them was in a half - whisper , especially on mrs . elton \\' s side , there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects : the post - office -- catching cold -- fetching letters -- and friendship , were long under discussion ; and to them succeeded one , which must be at least equally unpleasant to jane -- inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her , and professions of mrs . elton \\' s meditated activity . \" here is april come !\" said she , \" i get quite anxious about you . june will soon be here .\" \" but i have never fixed on june or any other month -- merely looked forward to the summer in general .\" \" but have you really heard of nothing ?\" \" i have not even made any inquiry ; i do not wish to make any yet .\" \" oh ! my dear , we cannot begin too early ; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing .\" \" i not aware !\" said jane , shaking her head ; \" dear mrs . elton , who can have thought of it as i have done ?\" \" but you have not seen so much of the world as i have . you do not know how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations . i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove . a cousin of mr . suckling , mrs . bragge , had such an infinity of applications ; every body was anxious to be in her family , for she moves in the first circle . wax - candles in the schoolroom ! you may imagine how desirable ! of all houses in the kingdom mrs . bragge \\' s is the one i would most wish to see you in .\" \" colonel and mrs . campbell are to be in town again by midsummer ,\" said jane . \" i must spend some time with them ; i am sure they will want it ;-- afterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself . but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present .\" \" trouble ! aye , i know your scruples . you are afraid of giving me trouble ; but i assure you , my dear jane , the campbells can hardly be more interested about you than i am . i shall write to mrs . partridge in a day or two , and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look - out for any thing eligible .\" \" thank you , but i would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , i do not wish to be giving any body trouble .\" \" but , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is april , and june , or say even july , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us . your inexperience really amuses me ! a situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment \\' s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly .\" \" excuse me , ma \\' am , but this is by no means my intention ; i make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends . when i am quite determined as to the time , i am not at all afraid of being long unemployed . there are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something -- offices for the sale -- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect .\" \" oh ! my dear , human flesh ! you quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , i assure you mr . suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition .\" \" i did not mean , i was not thinking of the slave - trade ,\" replied jane ; \" governess - trade , i assure you , was all that i had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , i do not know where it lies . but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices , and that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do .\" \" something that would do !\" repeated mrs . elton . \" aye , _that_ may suit your humble ideas of yourself ;-- i know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life .\" \" you are very obliging ; but as to all that , i am very indifferent ; it would be no object to me to be with the rich ; my mortifications , i think , would only be the greater ; i should suffer more from comparison . a gentleman \\' s family is all that i should condition for .\" \" i know you , i know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but i shall be a little more nice , and i am sure the good campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle . your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose ;-- that is -- i do not know -- if you knew the harp , you might do all that , i am very sure ; but you sing as well as play ;-- yes , i really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose ;-- and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the campbells or i have any rest .\" \" you may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together ,\" said jane , \" they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , i am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me . i am exceedingly obliged to you , mrs . elton , i am obliged to any body who feels for me , but i am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer . for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am , and as i am .\" \" and i am quite serious too , i assure you ,\" replied mrs . elton gaily , \" in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us .\" in this style she ran on ; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till mr . woodhouse came into the room ; her vanity had then a change of object , and emma heard her saying in the same half - whisper to jane , \" here comes this dear old beau of mine , i protest !-- only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men !-- what a dear creature he is ;-- i assure you i like him excessively . i admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me . but this good old mr . woodhouse , i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner . oh ! i assure you i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous . i fancy i am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my gown . how do you like it ?-- selina \\' s choice -- handsome , i think , but i do not know whether it is not over - trimmed ; i have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over - trimmed -- quite a horror of finery . i must put on a few ornaments now , because it is expected of me . a bride , you know , must appear like a bride , but my natural taste is all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery . but i am quite in the minority , i believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress ,-- show and finery are every thing . i have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin . do you think it will look well ?\" the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing - room when mr . weston made his appearance among them . he had returned to a late dinner , and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over . he had been too much expected by the best judges , for surprize -- but there was great joy . mr . woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now , as he would have been sorry to see him before . john knightley only was in mute astonishment .-- that a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in london , should set off again , and walk half a mile to another man \\' s house , for the sake of being in mixed company till bed - time , of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers , was a circumstance to strike him deeply . a man who had been in motion since eight o \\' clock in the morning , and might now have been still , who had been long talking , and might have been silent , who had been in more than one crowd , and might have been alone !-- such a man , to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside , and on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into the world !-- could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife , there would have been a motive ; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party . john knightley looked at him with amazement , then shrugged his shoulders , and said , \" i could not have believed it even of _him_ .\" mr . weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to mrs . weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room . he gave her a letter , it was from frank , and to herself ; he had met with it in his way , and had taken the liberty of opening it . \" read it , read it ,\" said he , \" it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to emma .\" the two ladies looked over it together ; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time , in a voice a little subdued , but very audible to every body . \" well , he is coming , you see ; good news , i think . well , what do you say to it ?-- i always told you he would be here again soon , did not i ?-- anne , my dear , did not i always tell you so , and you would not believe me ?-- in town next week , you see -- at the latest , i dare say ; for _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or saturday . as to her illness , all nothing of course . but it is an excellent thing to have frank among us again , so near as town . they will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us . this is precisely what i wanted . well , pretty good news , is not it ? have you finished it ? has emma read it all ? put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now . i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way .\" mrs . weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion . her looks and words had nothing to restrain them . she was happy , she knew she was happy , and knew she ought to be happy . her congratulations were warm and open ; but emma could not speak so fluently . _she_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings , and trying to understand the degree of her agitation , which she rather thought was considerable . mr . weston , however , too eager to be very observant , too communicative to want others to talk , was very well satisfied with what she did say , and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already . it was well that he took every body \\' s joy for granted , or he might not have thought either mr . woodhouse or mr . knightley particularly delighted . they were the first entitled , after mrs . weston and emma , to be made happy ;-- from them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax , but she was so deep in conversation with john knightley , that it would have been too positive an interruption ; and finding himself close to mrs . elton , and her attention disengaged , he necessarily began on the subject with her . chapter xviii \" i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you ,\" said mr . weston . mrs . elton , very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope , smiled most graciously . \" you have heard of a certain frank churchill , i presume ,\" he continued -- \" and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name .\" \" oh ! yes , and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance . i am sure mr . elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage .\" \" you are very obliging .-- frank will be extremely happy , i am sure .-- he is to be in town next week , if not sooner . we have notice of it in a letter to - day . i met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son \\' s hand , presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to mrs . weston . she is his principal correspondent , i assure you . i hardly ever get a letter .\" \" and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her ! oh ! mr . weston -- ( laughing affectedly ) i must protest against that .-- a most dangerous precedent indeed !-- i beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example .-- upon my word , if this is what i am to expect , we married women must begin to exert ourselves !-- oh ! mr . weston , i could not have believed it of you !\" \" aye , we men are sad fellows . you must take care of yourself , mrs . elton .-- this letter tells us -- it is a short letter -- written in a hurry , merely to give us notice -- it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on mrs . churchill \\' s account -- she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks enscombe too cold for her -- so they are all to move southward without loss of time .\" \" indeed !-- from yorkshire , i think . enscombe is in yorkshire ?\" \" yes , they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london . a considerable journey .\" \" yes , upon my word , very considerable . sixty - five miles farther than from maple grove to london . but what is distance , mr . weston , to people of large fortune ?-- you would be amazed to hear how my brother , mr . suckling , sometimes flies about . you will hardly believe me -- but twice in one week he and mr . bragge went to london and back again with four horses .\" \" the evil of the distance from enscombe ,\" said mr . weston , \" is , that mrs . churchill , _as_ _we_ _understand_ , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together . in frank \\' s last letter she complained , he said , of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle \\' s ! this , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road .-- so frank writes word . certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , mrs . elton . you must grant me that .\" \" no , indeed , i shall grant you nothing . i always take the part of my own sex . i do indeed . i give you notice -- you will find me a formidable antagonist on that point . i always stand up for women -- and i assure you , if you knew how selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn , you would not wonder at mrs . churchill \\' s making incredible exertions to avoid it . selina says it is quite horror to her -- and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety . she always travels with her own sheets ; an excellent precaution . does mrs . churchill do the same ?\" \" depend upon it , mrs . churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did . mrs . churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for \"-- mrs . elton eagerly interposed with , \" oh ! mr . weston , do not mistake me . selina is no fine lady , i assure you . do not run away with such an idea .\" \" is not she ? then she is no rule for mrs . churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld .\" mrs . elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly . it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _not_ a fine lady ; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it ;-- and she was considering in what way she had best retract , when mr . weston went on . \" mrs . churchill is not much in my good graces , as you may suspect -- but this is quite between ourselves . she is very fond of frank , and therefore i would not speak ill of her . besides , she is out of health now ; but _that_ indeed , by her own account , she has always been . i would not say so to every body , mrs . elton , but i have not much faith in mrs . churchill \\' s illness .\" \" if she is really ill , why not go to bath , mr . weston ?-- to bath , or to clifton ?\" \" she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too cold for her . the fact is , i suppose , that she is tired of enscombe . she has now been a longer time stationary there , than she ever was before , and she begins to want change . it is a retired place . a fine place , but very retired .\" \" aye -- like maple grove , i dare say . nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove . such an immense plantation all round it ! you seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement .-- and mrs . churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion . or , perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life . i always say a woman cannot have too many resources -- and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society .\" \" frank was here in february for a fortnight .\" \" so i remember to have heard . he will find an _addition_ to the society of highbury when he comes again ; that is , if i may presume to call myself an addition . but perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world .\" this was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by , and mr . weston , with a very good grace , immediately exclaimed , \" my dear madam ! nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible . not heard of you !-- i believe mrs . weston \\' s letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs . elton .\" he had done his duty and could return to his son . \" when frank left us ,\" continued he , \" it was quite uncertain when we might see him again , which makes this day \\' s news doubly welcome . it has been completely unexpected . that is , _i_ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , i was sure something favourable would turn up -- but nobody believed me . he and mrs . weston were both dreadfully desponding . ` how could he contrive to come ? and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ?\\' and so forth -- i always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see . i have observed , mrs . elton , in the course of my life , that if things are going untowardly one month , they are sure to mend the next .\" \" very true , mr . weston , perfectly true . it is just what i used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _may_ before hymen \\' s saffron robe would be put on for us . oh ! the pains i have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views ! the carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage ;-- one morning , i remember , he came to me quite in despair .\" she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing , and mr . weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on . \" you were mentioning may . may is the very month which mrs . churchill is ordered , or has ordered herself , to spend in some warmer place than enscombe -- in short , to spend in london ; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring -- precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it : days almost at the longest ; weather genial and pleasant , always inviting one out , and never too hot for exercise . when he was here before , we made the best of it ; but there was a good deal of wet , damp , cheerless weather ; there always is in february , you know , and we could not do half that we intended . now will be the time . this will be complete enjoyment ; and i do not know , mrs . elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house . i think it is so . i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight . i hope you will be pleased with my son ; but you must not expect a prodigy . he is generally thought a fine young man , but do not expect a prodigy . mrs . weston \\' s partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me . she thinks nobody equal to him .\" \" and i assure you , mr . weston , i have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour . i have heard so much in praise of mr . frank churchill .-- at the same time it is fair to observe , that i am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others . i give you notice that as i find your son , so i shall judge of him .-- i am no flatterer .\" mr . weston was musing . \" i hope ,\" said he presently , \" i have not been severe upon poor mrs . churchill . if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice ; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish . you cannot be ignorant , mrs . elton , of my connexion with the family , nor of the treatment i have met with ; and , between ourselves , the whole blame of it is to be laid to her . she was the instigator . frank \\' s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her . mr . churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife \\' s : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence ! and what inclines one less to bear , she has no fair pretence of family or blood . she was nobody when he married her , barely the daughter of a gentleman ; but ever since her being turned into a churchill she has out - churchill \\' d them all in high and mighty claims : but in herself , i assure you , she is an upstart .\" \" only think ! well , that must be infinitely provoking ! i have quite a horror of upstarts . maple grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort ; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves ! your description of mrs . churchill made me think of them directly . people of the name of tupman , very lately settled there , and encumbered with many low connexions , but giving themselves immense airs , and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families . a year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at west hall ; and how they got their fortune nobody knows . they came from birmingham , which is not a place to promise much , you know , mr . weston . one has not great hopes from birmingham . i always say there is something direful in the sound : but nothing more is positively known of the tupmans , though a good many things i assure you are suspected ; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother , mr . suckling , who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours . it is infinitely too bad . mr . suckling , who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove , and whose father had it before him -- i believe , at least -- i am almost sure that old mr . suckling had completed the purchase before his death .\" they were interrupted . tea was carrying round , and mr . weston , having said all that he wanted , soon took the opportunity of walking away . after tea , mr . and mrs . weston , and mr . elton sat down with mr . woodhouse to cards . the remaining five were left to their own powers , and emma doubted their getting on very well ; for mr . knightley seemed little disposed for conversation ; mrs . elton was wanting notice , which nobody had inclination to pay , and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent . mr . john knightley proved more talkative than his brother . he was to leave them early the next day ; and he soon began with -- \" well , emma , i do not believe i have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister \\' s letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure . my charge would be much more concise than her \\' s , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that i have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them .\" \" i rather hope to satisfy you both ,\" said emma , \" for i shall do all in my power to make them happy , which will be enough for isabella ; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic .\" \" and if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again .\" \" that is very likely . you think so , do not you ?\" \" i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father -- or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately .\" \" increase !\" \" certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half - year has made a great difference in your way of life .\" \" difference ! no indeed i am not .\" \" there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be . witness this very time . here am i come down for only one day , and you are engaged with a dinner - party !-- when did it happen before , or any thing like it ? your neighbourhood is increasing , and you mix more with it . a little while ago , every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at mr . cole \\' s , or balls at the crown . the difference which randalls , randalls alone makes in your goings - on , is very great .\" \" yes ,\" said his brother quickly , \" it is randalls that does it all .\" \" very well -- and as randalls , i suppose , is not likely to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me as a possible thing , emma , that henry and john may be sometimes in the way . and if they are , i only beg you to send them home .\" \" no ,\" cried mr . knightley , \" that need not be the consequence . let them be sent to donwell . i shall certainly be at leisure .\" \" upon my word ,\" exclaimed emma , \" you amuse me ! i should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys . these amazing engagements of mine -- what have they been ? dining once with the coles -- and having a ball talked of , which never took place . i can understand you --( nodding at mr . john knightley )-- your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here , delights you too much to pass unnoticed . but you , ( turning to mr . knightley ,) who know how very , very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , i cannot imagine . and as to my dear little boys , i must say , that if aunt emma has not time for them , i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley , who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one -- and who , when he is at home , is either reading to himself or settling his accounts .\" mr . knightley seemed to be trying not to smile ; and succeeded without difficulty , upon mrs . elton \\' s beginning to talk to him . volume iii chapter i a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill . she was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for him . her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing ; it was not worth thinking of ;-- but if he , who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two , were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away , it would be very distressing . if a separation of two months should not have cooled him , there were dangers and evils before her :-- caution for him and for herself would be necessary . she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again , and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his . she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration . that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance ! and yet , she could not help rather anticipating something decisive . she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis , an event , a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state . it was not very long , though rather longer than mr . weston had foreseen , before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchill \\' s feelings . the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined , but he was at highbury very soon afterwards . he rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from randalls immediately to hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act . they met with the utmost friendliness . there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her . but she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done , of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree . she watched him well . it was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been . absence , with the conviction probably of her indifference , had produced this very natural and very desirable effect . he was in high spirits ; as ready to talk and laugh as ever , and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit , and recur to old stories : and he was not without agitation . it was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference . he was not calm ; his spirits were evidently fluttered ; there was restlessness about him . lively as he was , it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself ; but what decided her belief on the subject , was his staying only a quarter of an hour , and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury . \" he had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed -- he had not stopped , he would not stop for more than a word -- but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call , and much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield , he must hurry off .\" she had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits , nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power , and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long . this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days . he was often hoping , intending to come -- but was always prevented . his aunt could not bear to have him leave her . such was his own account at randall \\' s . if he were quite sincere , if he really tried to come , it was to be inferred that mrs . churchill \\' s removal to london had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder . that she was really ill was very certain ; he had declared himself convinced of it , at randalls . though much might be fancy , he could not doubt , when he looked back , that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago . he did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove , or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her ; but he could not be prevailed on , by all his father \\' s doubts , to say that her complaints were merely imaginary , or that she was as strong as ever . it soon appeared that london was not the place for her . she could not endure its noise . her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering ; and by the ten days \\' end , her nephew \\' s letter to randalls communicated a change of plan . they were going to remove immediately to richmond . mrs . churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there , and had otherwise a fancy for the place . a ready - furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged , and much benefit expected from the change . emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement , and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends -- for the house was taken for may and june . she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish . emma saw how mr . weston understood these joyous prospects . he was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered . she hoped it was not so . two months must bring it to the proof . mr . weston \\' s own happiness was indisputable . he was quite delighted . it was the very circumstance he could have wished for . now , it would be really having frank in their neighbourhood . what were nine miles to a young man ?-- an hour \\' s ride . he would be always coming over . the difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never . sixteen miles -- nay , eighteen -- it must be full eighteen to manchester - street -- was a serious obstacle . were he ever able to get away , the day would be spent in coming and returning . there was no comfort in having him in london ; he might as well be at enscombe ; but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse . better than nearer ! one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal ,-- the ball at the crown . it had not been forgotten before , but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day . now , however , it was absolutely to be ; every preparation was resumed , and very soon after the churchills had removed to richmond , a few lines from frank , to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change , and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty - four hours at any given time , induced them to name as early a day as possible . mr . weston \\' s ball was to be a real thing . a very few to - morrows stood between the young people of highbury and happiness . mr . woodhouse was resigned . the time of year lightened the evil to him . may was better for every thing than february . mrs . bates was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield , james had due notice , and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear little john would have any thing the matter with them , while dear emma were gone . chapter ii no misfortune occurred , again to prevent the ball . the day approached , the day arrived ; and after a morning of some anxious watching , frank churchill , in all the certainty of his own self , reached randalls before dinner , and every thing was safe . no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma . the room at the crown was to witness it ;-- but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd . mr . weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves , for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came , that she could not refuse him , and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man \\' s company . she was to convey harriet , and they drove to the crown in good time , the randalls party just sufficiently before them . frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch ; and though he did not say much , his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening . they all walked about together , to see that every thing was as it should be ; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage , which emma could not hear the sound of at first , without great surprize . \" so unreasonably early !\" she was going to exclaim ; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends , who were coming , like herself , by particular desire , to help mr . weston \\' s judgment ; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins , who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness , on the same errand , that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection . emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which mr . weston depended , and felt , that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes , was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity . she liked his open manners , but a little less of open - heartedness would have made him a higher character .-- general benevolence , but not general friendship , made a man what he ought to be .-- she could fancy such a man . the whole party walked about , and looked , and praised again ; and then , having nothing else to do , formed a sort of half - circle round the fire , to observe in their various modes , till other subjects were started , that , though _may_ , a fire in the evening was still very pleasant . emma found that it was not mr . weston \\' s fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger . they had stopped at mrs . bates \\' s door to offer the use of their carriage , but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons . frank was standing by her , but not steadily ; there was a restlessness , which shewed a mind not at ease . he was looking about , he was going to the door , he was watching for the sound of other carriages ,-- impatient to begin , or afraid of being always near her . mrs . elton was spoken of . \" i think she must be here soon ,\" said he . \" i have a great curiosity to see mrs . elton , i have heard so much of her . it cannot be long , i think , before she comes .\" a carriage was heard . he was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said , \" i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her . i have never seen either mr . or mrs . elton . i have no business to put myself forward .\" mr . and mrs . elton appeared ; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed . \" but miss bates and miss fairfax !\" said mr . weston , looking about . \" we thought you were to bring them .\" the mistake had been slight . the carriage was sent for them now . emma longed to know what frank \\' s first opinion of mrs . elton might be ; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress , and her smiles of graciousness . he was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion , by giving her very proper attention , after the introduction had passed . in a few minutes the carriage returned .-- somebody talked of rain .-- \" i will see that there are umbrellas , sir ,\" said frank to his father : \" miss bates must not be forgotten :\" and away he went . mr . weston was following ; but mrs . elton detained him , to gratify him by her opinion of his son ; and so briskly did she begin , that the young man himself , though by no means moving slowly , could hardly be out of hearing . \" a very fine young man indeed , mr . weston . you know i candidly told you i should form my own opinion ; and i am happy to say that i am extremely pleased with him .-- you may believe me . i never compliment . i think him a very handsome young man , and his manners are precisely what i like and approve -- so truly the gentleman , without the least conceit or puppyism . you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies -- quite a horror of them . they were never tolerated at maple grove . neither mr . suckling nor me had ever any patience with them ; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things ! selina , who is mild almost to a fault , bore with them much better .\" while she talked of his son , mr . weston \\' s attention was chained ; but when she got to maple grove , he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to , and with happy smiles must hurry away . mrs . elton turned to mrs . weston . \" i have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane . our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious !-- i believe we drive faster than any body .-- what a pleasure it is to send one \\' s carriage for a friend !-- i understand you were so kind as to offer , but another time it will be quite unnecessary . you may be very sure i shall always take care of _them_ .\" miss bates and miss fairfax , escorted by the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and mrs . elton seemed to think it as much her duty as mrs . weston \\' s to receive them . her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma ; but her words , every body \\' s words , were soon lost under the incessant flow of miss bates , who came in talking , and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire . as the door opened she was heard , \" so very obliging of you !-- no rain at all . nothing to signify . i do not care for myself . quite thick shoes . and jane declares -- well !--( as soon as she was within the door ) well ! this is brilliant indeed !-- this is admirable !-- excellently contrived , upon my word . nothing wanting . could not have imagined it .-- so well lighted up !-- jane , jane , look !-- did you ever see any thing ? oh ! mr . weston , you must really have had aladdin \\' s lamp . good mrs . stokes would not know her own room again . i saw her as i came in ; she was standing in the entrance . ` oh ! mrs . stokes ,\\' said i -- but i had not time for more .\" she was now met by mrs . weston .-- \" very well , i thank you , ma \\' am . i hope you are quite well . very happy to hear it . so afraid you might have a headache !-- seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have . delighted to hear it indeed . ah ! dear mrs . elton , so obliged to you for the carriage !-- excellent time . jane and i quite ready . did not keep the horses a moment . most comfortable carriage .-- oh ! and i am sure our thanks are due to you , mrs . weston , on that score . mrs . elton had most kindly sent jane a note , or we should have been .-- but two such offers in one day !-- never were such neighbours . i said to my mother , ` upon my word , ma \\' am --.\\' thank you , my mother is remarkably well . gone to mr . woodhouse \\' s . i made her take her shawl -- for the evenings are not warm -- her large new shawl -- mrs . dixon \\' s wedding - present .-- so kind of her to think of my mother ! bought at weymouth , you know -- mr . dixon \\' s choice . there were three others , jane says , which they hesitated about some time . colonel campbell rather preferred an olive . my dear jane , are you sure you did not wet your feet ?-- it was but a drop or two , but i am so afraid :-- but mr . frank churchill was so extremely -- and there was a mat to step upon -- i shall never forget his extreme politeness .-- oh ! mr . frank churchill , i must tell you my mother \\' s spectacles have never been in fault since ; the rivet never came out again . my mother often talks of your good - nature . does not she , jane ?-- do not we often talk of mr . frank churchill ?-- ah ! here \\' s miss woodhouse .-- dear miss woodhouse , how do you do ?-- very well i thank you , quite well . this is meeting quite in fairy - land !-- such a transformation !-- must not compliment , i know ( eyeing emma most complacently )-- that would be rude -- but upon my word , miss woodhouse , you do look -- how do you like jane \\' s hair ?-- you are a judge .-- she did it all herself . quite wonderful how she does her hair !-- no hairdresser from london i think could .-- ah ! dr . hughes i declare -- and mrs . hughes . must go and speak to dr . and mrs . hughes for a moment .-- how do you do ? how do you do ?-- very well , i thank you . this is delightful , is not it ?-- where \\' s dear mr . richard ?-- oh ! there he is . don \\' t disturb him . much better employed talking to the young ladies . how do you do , mr . richard ?-- i saw you the other day as you rode through the town -- mrs . otway , i protest !-- and good mr . otway , and miss otway and miss caroline .-- such a host of friends !-- and mr . george and mr . arthur !-- how do you do ? how do you all do ?-- quite well , i am much obliged to you . never better .-- don \\' t i hear another carriage ?-- who can this be ?-- very likely the worthy coles .-- upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends ! and such a noble fire !-- i am quite roasted . no coffee , i thank you , for me -- never take coffee .-- a little tea if you please , sir , by and bye ,-- no hurry -- oh ! here it comes . every thing so good !\" frank churchill returned to his station by emma ; and as soon as miss bates was quiet , she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of mrs . elton and miss fairfax , who were standing a little way behind her .-- he was thoughtful . whether he were overhearing too , she could not determine . after a good many compliments to jane on her dress and look , compliments very quietly and properly taken , mrs . elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself -- and it was , \" how do you like my gown ?-- how do you like my trimming ?-- how has wright done my hair ?\"-- with many other relative questions , all answered with patient politeness . mrs . elton then said , \" nobody can think less of dress in general than i do -- but upon such an occasion as this , when every body \\' s eyes are so much upon me , and in compliment to the westons -- who i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour -- i would not wish to be inferior to others . and i see very few pearls in the room except mine .-- so frank churchill is a capital dancer , i understand .-- we shall see if our styles suit .-- a fine young man certainly is frank churchill . i like him very well .\" at this moment frank began talking so vigorously , that emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises , and did not want to hear more ;-- and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while , till another suspension brought mrs . elton \\' s tones again distinctly forward .-- mr . elton had just joined them , and his wife was exclaiming , \" oh ! you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion ?-- i was this moment telling jane , i thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us .\" \" jane !\"-- repeated frank churchill , with a look of surprize and displeasure .-- \" that is easy -- but miss fairfax does not disapprove it , i suppose .\" \" how do you like mrs . elton ?\" said emma in a whisper . \" not at all .\" \" you are ungrateful .\" \" ungrateful !-- what do you mean ?\" then changing from a frown to a smile --\" no , do not tell me -- i do not want to know what you mean .-- where is my father ?-- when are we to begin dancing ?\" emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour . he walked off to find his father , but was quickly back again with both mr . and mrs . weston . he had met with them in a little perplexity , which must be laid before emma . it had just occurred to mrs . weston that mrs . elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinction .-- emma heard the sad truth with fortitude . \" and what are we to do for a proper partner for her ?\" said mr . weston . \" she will think frank ought to ask her .\" frank turned instantly to emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of -- and it then appeared that mrs . weston was wanting _him_ to dance with mrs . elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon .-- mr . weston and mrs . elton led the way , mr . frank churchill and miss woodhouse followed . emma must submit to stand second to mrs . elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her . it was almost enough to make her think of marrying . mrs . elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill , she could not lose by the change . mr . weston might be his son \\' s superior .-- in spite of this little rub , however , emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her .-- she was more disturbed by mr . knightley \\' s not dancing than by any thing else .-- there he was , among the standers - by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing ,-- not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist - players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up ,-- so young as he looked !-- he could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself . his tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as emma felt must draw every body \\' s eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him .-- he moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble .-- whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave . she wished he could love a ballroom better , and could like frank churchill better .-- he seemed often observing her . she must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid . there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner . they seemed more like cheerful , easy friends , than lovers . that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done , was indubitable . the ball proceeded pleasantly . the anxious cares , the incessant attentions of mrs . weston , were not thrown away . every body seemed happy ; and the praise of being a delightful ball , which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be , was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this . of very important , very recordable events , it was not more productive than such meetings usually are . there was one , however , which emma thought something of .-- the two last dances before supper were begun , and harriet had no partner ;-- the only young lady sitting down ;-- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder !-- but emma \\' s wonder lessened soon afterwards , on seeing mr . elton sauntering about . he would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room . escape , however , was not his plan . he came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected , spoke to some , and walked about in front of them , as if to shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it . he did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith , or speaking to those who were close to her .-- emma saw it . she was not yet dancing ; she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all . when she was half - way up the set , the whole group were exactly behind her , and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch ; but mr . elton was so near , that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and mrs . weston ; and she perceived that his wife , who was standing immediately above her , was not only listening also , but even encouraging him by significant glances .-- the kind - hearted , gentle mrs . weston had left her seat to join him and say , \" do not you dance , mr . elton ?\" to which his prompt reply was , \" most readily , mrs . weston , if you will dance with me .\" \" me !-- oh ! no -- i would get you a better partner than myself . i am no dancer .\" \" if mrs . gilbert wishes to dance ,\" said he , \" i shall have great pleasure , i am sure -- for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man , and that my dancing days are over , it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs . gilbert .\" \" mrs . gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancing -- miss smith .\" \" miss smith !-- oh !-- i had not observed .-- you are extremely obliging -- and if i were not an old married man .-- but my dancing days are over , mrs . weston . you will excuse me . any thing else i should be most happy to do , at your command -- but my dancing days are over .\" mrs . weston said no more ; and emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat . this was mr . elton ! the amiable , obliging , gentle mr . elton .-- she looked round for a moment ; he had joined mr . knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife . she would not look again . her heart was in a glow , and she feared her face might be as hot . in another moment a happier sight caught her ;-- mr . knightley leading harriet to the set !-- never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant . she was all pleasure and gratitude , both for harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again . his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if it had not been for the cruel state of things before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced . it was not thrown away on her , she bounded higher than ever , flew farther down the middle , and was in a continual course of smiles . mr . elton had retreated into the card - room , looking ( emma trusted ) very foolish . she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife , though growing very like her ;-- _she_ spoke some of her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner , \" knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith !-- very goodnatured , i declare .\" supper was announced . the move began ; and miss bates might be heard from that moment , without interruption , till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon . \" jane , jane , my dear jane , where are you ?-- here is your tippet . mrs . weston begs you to put on your tippet . she says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage , though every thing has been done -- one door nailed up -- quantities of matting -- my dear jane , indeed you must . mr . churchill , oh ! you are too obliging ! how well you put it on !-- so gratified ! excellent dancing indeed !-- yes , my dear , i ran home , as i said i should , to help grandmama to bed , and got back again , and nobody missed me .-- i set off without saying a word , just as i told you . grandmama was quite well , had a charming evening with mr . woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon .-- tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away : amazing luck in some of her throws : and she inquired a great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners . ` oh !\\' said i , ` i shall not forestall jane ; i left her dancing with mr . george otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was mr . elton , i do not know who will ask her next , perhaps mr . william cox .\\' my dear sir , you are too obliging .-- is there nobody you would not rather ?-- i am not helpless . sir , you are most kind . upon my word , jane on one arm , and me on the other !-- stop , stop , let us stand a little back , mrs . elton is going ; dear mrs . elton , how elegant she looks !-- beautiful lace !-- now we all follow in her train . quite the queen of the evening !-- well , here we are at the passage . two steps , jane , take care of the two steps . oh ! no , there is but one . well , i was persuaded there were two . how very odd ! i was convinced there were two , and there is but one . i never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style -- candles everywhere .-- i was telling you of your grandmama , jane ,-- there was a little disappointment .-- the baked apples and biscuits , excellent in their way , you know ; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first , and good mr . woodhouse , not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all out again . now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus -- so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned !-- well , this is brilliant ! i am all amazement ! could not have supposed any thing !-- such elegance and profusion !-- i have seen nothing like it since -- well , where shall we sit ? where shall we sit ? anywhere , so that jane is not in a draught . where _i_ sit is of no consequence . oh ! do you recommend this side ?-- well , i am sure , mr . churchill -- only it seems too good -- but just as you please . what you direct in this house cannot be wrong . dear jane , how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama ? soup too ! bless me ! i should not be helped so soon , but it smells most excellent , and i cannot help beginning .\" emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr . knightley till after supper ; but , when they were all in the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked . he was warm in his reprobation of mr . elton \\' s conduct ; it had been unpardonable rudeness ; and mrs . elton \\' s looks also received the due share of censure . \" they aimed at wounding more than harriet ,\" said he . \" emma , why is it that they are your enemies ?\" he looked with smiling penetration ; and , on receiving no answer , added , \" _she_ ought not to be angry with you , i suspect , whatever he may be .-- to that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , emma , that you did want him to marry harriet .\" \" i did ,\" replied emma , \" and they cannot forgive me .\" he shook his head ; but there was a smile of indulgence with it , and he only said , \" i shall not scold you . i leave you to your own reflections .\" \" can you trust me with such flatterers ?-- does my vain spirit ever tell me i am wrong ?\" \" not your vain spirit , but your serious spirit .-- if one leads you wrong , i am sure the other tells you of it .\" \" i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr . elton . there is a littleness about him which you discovered , and which i did not : and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet . it was through a series of strange blunders !\" \" and , in return for your acknowledging so much , i will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself .-- harriet smith has some first - rate qualities , which mrs . elton is totally without . an unpretending , single - minded , artless girl -- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs . elton . i found harriet more conversable than i expected .\" emma was extremely gratified .-- they were interrupted by the bustle of mr . weston calling on every body to begin dancing again . \" come miss woodhouse , miss otway , miss fairfax , what are you all doing ?-- come emma , set your companions the example . every body is lazy ! every body is asleep !\" \" i am ready ,\" said emma , \" whenever i am wanted .\" \" whom are you going to dance with ?\" asked mr . knightley . she hesitated a moment , and then replied , \" with you , if you will ask me .\" \" will you ?\" said he , offering his hand . \" indeed i will . you have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper .\" \" brother and sister ! no , indeed .\" chapter iii this little explanation with mr . knightley gave emma considerable pleasure . it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy .-- she was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying . the impertinence of the eltons , which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening , had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions ; and she looked forward to another happy result -- the cure of harriet \\' s infatuation .-- from harriet \\' s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom , she had strong hopes . it seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened , and she were enabled to see that mr . elton was not the superior creature she had believed him . the fever was over , and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy . she depended on the evil feelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite .-- harriet rational , frank churchill not too much in love , and mr . knightley not wanting to quarrel with her , how very happy a summer must be before her ! she was not to see frank churchill this morning . he had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield , as he was to be at home by the middle of the day . she did not regret it . having arranged all these matters , looked them through , and put them all to rights , she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys , as well as of their grandpapa , when the great iron sweep - gate opened , and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together -- frank churchill , with harriet leaning on his arm -- actually harriet !-- a moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened . harriet looked white and frightened , and he was trying to cheer her .-- the iron gates and the front - door were not twenty yards asunder ;-- they were all three soon in the hall , and harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away . a young lady who faints , must be recovered ; questions must be answered , and surprizes be explained . such events are very interesting , but the suspense of them cannot last long . a few minutes made emma acquainted with the whole . miss smith , and miss bickerton , another parlour boarder at mrs . goddard \\' s , who had been also at the ball , had walked out together , and taken a road , the richmond road , which , though apparently public enough for safety , had led them into alarm .-- about half a mile beyond highbury , making a sudden turn , and deeply shaded by elms on each side , it became for a considerable stretch very retired ; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it , they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them , on a broader patch of greensward by the side , a party of gipsies . a child on the watch , came towards them to beg ; and miss bickerton , excessively frightened , gave a great scream , and calling on harriet to follow her , ran up a steep bank , cleared a slight hedge at the top , and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury . but poor harriet could not follow . she had suffered very much from cramp after dancing , and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless -- and in this state , and exceedingly terrified , she had been obliged to remain . how the trampers might have behaved , had the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful ; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted ; and harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children , headed by a stout woman and a great boy , all clamorous , and impertinent in look , though not absolutely in word .-- more and more frightened , she immediately promised them money , and taking out her purse , gave them a shilling , and begged them not to want more , or to use her ill .-- she was then able to walk , though but slowly , and was moving away -- but her terror and her purse were too tempting , and she was followed , or rather surrounded , by the whole gang , demanding more . in this state frank churchill had found her , she trembling and conditioning , they loud and insolent . by a most fortunate chance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment . the pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward , and leave his horses to meet him by another road , a mile or two beyond highbury -- and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of miss bates , and to have forgotten to restore them , he had been obliged to stop at her door , and go in for a few minutes : he was therefore later than he had intended ; and being on foot , was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them . the terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet was then their own portion . he had left them completely frightened ; and harriet eagerly clinging to him , and hardly able to speak , had just strength enough to reach hartfield , before her spirits were quite overcome . it was his idea to bring her to hartfield : he had thought of no other place . this was the amount of the whole story ,-- of his communication and of harriet \\' s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech .-- he dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to mrs . goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr . knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself . such an adventure as this ,-- a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way , could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain . so emma thought , at least . could a linguist , could a grammarian , could even a mathematician have seen what she did , have witnessed their appearance together , and heard their history of it , without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other ?-- how much more must an imaginist , like herself , be on fire with speculation and foresight !-- especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made . it was a very extraordinary thing ! nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place , within her memory ; no rencontre , no alarm of the kind ;-- and now it had happened to the very person , and at the very hour , when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her !-- it certainly was very extraordinary !-- and knowing , as she did , the favourable state of mind of each at this period , it struck her the more . he was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself , she just recovering from her mania for mr . elton . it seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences . it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other . in the few minutes \\' conversation which she had yet had with him , while harriet had been partially insensible , he had spoken of her terror , her naivete , her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm , with a sensibility amused and delighted ; and just at last , after harriet \\' s own account had been given , he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms . every thing was to take its natural course , however , neither impelled nor assisted . she would not stir a step , nor drop a hint . no , she had had enough of interference . there could be no harm in a scheme , a mere passive scheme . it was no more than a wish . beyond it she would on no account proceed . emma \\' s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed ,-- aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion : but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible . within half an hour it was known all over highbury . it was the very event to engage those who talk most , the young and the low ; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news . the last night \\' s ball seemed lost in the gipsies . poor mr . woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again . it was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after ), as well as miss smith , were coming in during the rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer , that they were all very indifferent -- which , though not exactly true , for she was perfectly well , and harriet not much otherwise , emma would not interfere with . she had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man , for she hardly knew what indisposition was ; and if he did not invent illnesses for her , she could make no figure in a message . the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice ; they took themselves off in a hurry . the young ladies of highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began , and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to emma and her nephews :-- in her imagination it maintained its ground , and henry and john were still asking every day for the story of harriet and the gipsies , and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital . chapter iv a very few days had passed after this adventure , when harriet came one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting down and hesitating , thus began : \" miss woodhouse -- if you are at leisure -- i have something that i should like to tell you -- a sort of confession to make -- and then , you know , it will be over .\" emma was a good deal surprized ; but begged her to speak . there was a seriousness in harriet \\' s manner which prepared her , quite as much as her words , for something more than ordinary . \" it is my duty , and i am sure it is my wish ,\" she continued , \" to have no reserves with you on this subject . as i am happily quite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it . i do not want to say more than is necessary -- i am too much ashamed of having given way as i have done , and i dare say you understand me .\" \" yes ,\" said emma , \" i hope i do .\" \" how i could so long a time be fancying myself ! . . .\" cried harriet , warmly . \" it seems like madness ! i can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now .-- i do not care whether i meet him or not -- except that of the two i had rather not see him -- and indeed i would go any distance round to avoid him -- but i do not envy his wife in the least ; i neither admire her nor envy her , as i have done : she is very charming , i dare say , and all that , but i think her very ill - tempered and disagreeable -- i shall never forget her look the other night !-- however , i assure you , miss woodhouse , i wish her no evil .-- no , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment \\' s pang : and to convince you that i have been speaking truth , i am now going to destroy -- what i ought to have destroyed long ago -- what i ought never to have kept -- i know that very well ( blushing as she spoke ).-- however , now i will destroy it all -- and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational i am grown . cannot you guess what this parcel holds ?\" said she , with a conscious look . \" not the least in the world .-- did he ever give you any thing ?\" \" no -- i cannot call them gifts ; but they are things that i have valued very much .\" she held the parcel towards her , and emma read the words _most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top . her curiosity was greatly excited . harriet unfolded the parcel , and she looked on with impatience . within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridge - ware box , which harriet opened : it was well lined with the softest cotton ; but , excepting the cotton , emma saw only a small piece of court - plaister . \" now ,\" said harriet , \" you _must_ recollect .\" \" no , indeed i do not .\" \" dear me ! i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it !-- it was but a very few days before i had my sore throat -- just before mr . and mrs . john knightley came -- i think the very evening .-- do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court - plaister ?-- but , as you had none about you , and knew i had , you desired me to supply him ; and so i took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me . and so then , in my nonsense , i could not help making a treasure of it -- so i put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat .\" \" my dearest harriet !\" cried emma , putting her hand before her face , and jumping up , \" you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear . remember it ? aye , i remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic -- i knew nothing of that till this moment -- but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying i had none about me !-- oh ! my sins , my sins !-- and i had plenty all the while in my pocket !-- one of my senseless tricks !-- i deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life .-- well --( sitting down again )-- go on -- what else ?\" \" and had you really some at hand yourself ? i am sure i never suspected it , you did it so naturally .\" \" and so you actually put this piece of court - plaister by for his sake !\" said emma , recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement . and secretly she added to herself , \" lord bless me ! when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that frank churchill had been pulling about ! i never was equal to this .\" \" here ,\" resumed harriet , turning to her box again , \" here is something still more valuable , i mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did .\" emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure . it was the end of an old pencil ,-- the part without any lead . \" this was really his ,\" said harriet .--\" do not you remember one morning ?-- no , i dare say you do not . but one morning -- i forget exactly the day -- but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before _that_ _evening_ , he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket - book ; it was about spruce - beer . mr . knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce - beer , and he wanted to put it down ; but when he took out his pencil , there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away , and it would not do , so you lent him another , and this was left upon the table as good for nothing . but i kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as i dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment .\" \" i do remember it ,\" cried emma ; \" i perfectly remember it .-- talking about spruce - beer .-- oh ! yes -- mr . knightley and i both saying we liked it , and mr . elton \\' s seeming resolved to learn to like it too . i perfectly remember it .-- stop ; mr . knightley was standing just here , was not he ? i have an idea he was standing just here .\" \" ah ! i do not know . i cannot recollect .-- it is very odd , but i cannot recollect .-- mr . elton was sitting here , i remember , much about where i am now .\"-- \" well , go on .\" \" oh ! that \\' s all . i have nothing more to shew you , or to say -- except that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire , and i wish you to see me do it .\" \" my poor dear harriet ! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ?\" \" yes , simpleton as i was !-- but i am quite ashamed of it now , and wish i could forget as easily as i can burn them . it was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married . i knew it was -- but had not resolution enough to part with them .\" \" but , harriet , is it necessary to burn the court - plaister ?-- i have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil , but the court - plaister might be useful .\" \" i shall be happier to burn it ,\" replied harriet . \" it has a disagreeable look to me . i must get rid of every thing .-- there it goes , and there is an end , thank heaven ! of mr . elton .\" \" and when ,\" thought emma , \" will there be a beginning of mr . churchill ?\" she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made , and could not but hope that the gipsy , though she had _told_ no fortune , might be proved to have made harriet \\' s .-- about a fortnight after the alarm , they came to a sufficient explanation , and quite undesignedly . emma was not thinking of it at the moment , which made the information she received more valuable . she merely said , in the course of some trivial chat , \" well , harriet , whenever you marry i would advise you to do so and so \"-- and thought no more of it , till after a minute \\' s silence she heard harriet say in a very serious tone , \" i shall never marry .\" emma then looked up , and immediately saw how it was ; and after a moment \\' s debate , as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not , replied , \" never marry !-- this is a new resolution .\" \" it is one that i shall never change , however .\" after another short hesitation , \" i hope it does not proceed from -- i hope it is not in compliment to mr . elton ?\" \" mr . elton indeed !\" cried harriet indignantly .--\" oh ! no \"-- and emma could just catch the words , \" so superior to mr . elton !\" she then took a longer time for consideration . should she proceed no farther ?-- should she let it pass , and seem to suspect nothing ?-- perhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps if she were totally silent , it might only drive harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been , such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances , she was perfectly resolved .-- she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once , all that she meant to say and know . plain dealing was always best . she had previously determined how far she would proceed , on any application of the sort ; and it would be safer for both , to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed .-- she was decided , and thus spoke -- \" harriet , i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning . your resolution , or rather your expectation of never marrying , results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer , would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you . is not it so ?\" \" oh ! miss woodhouse , believe me i have not the presumption to suppose -- indeed i am not so mad .-- but it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance -- and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world , with the gratitude , wonder , and veneration , which are so proper , in me especially .\" \" i am not at all surprized at you , harriet . the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart .\" \" service ! oh ! it was such an inexpressible obligation !-- the very recollection of it , and all that i felt at the time -- when i saw him coming -- his noble look -- and my wretchedness before . such a change ! in one moment such a change ! from perfect misery to perfect happiness !\" \" it is very natural . it is natural , and it is honourable .-- yes , honourable , i think , to chuse so well and so gratefully .-- but that it will be a fortunate preference is more that i can promise . i do not advise you to give way to it , harriet . i do not by any means engage for its being returned . consider what you are about . perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you . be observant of him . let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations . i give you this caution now , because i shall never speak to you again on the subject . i am determined against all interference . henceforward i know nothing of the matter . let no name ever pass our lips . we were very wrong before ; we will be cautious now .-- he is your superior , no doubt , and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature ; but yet , harriet , more wonderful things have taken place , there have been matches of greater disparity . but take care of yourself . i would not have you too sanguine ; though , however it may end , be assured your raising your thoughts to _him_ , is a mark of good taste which i shall always know how to value .\" harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude . emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend . its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind -- and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation . chapter v in this state of schemes , and hopes , and connivance , june opened upon hartfield . to highbury in general it brought no material change . the eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings , and of the use to be made of their barouche - landau ; and jane fairfax was still at her grandmother \\' s ; and as the return of the campbells from ireland was again delayed , and august , instead of midsummer , fixed for it , she was likely to remain there full two months longer , provided at least she were able to defeat mrs . elton \\' s activity in her service , and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will . mr . knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to frank churchill , was only growing to dislike him more . he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of emma . that emma was his object appeared indisputable . every thing declared it ; his own attentions , his father \\' s hints , his mother - in - law \\' s guarded silence ; it was all in unison ; words , conduct , discretion , and indiscretion , told the same story . but while so many were devoting him to emma , and emma herself making him over to harriet , mr . knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax . he could not understand it ; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them -- he thought so at least -- symptoms of admiration on his side , which , having once observed , he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning , however he might wish to escape any of emma \\' s errors of imagination . _she_ was not present when the suspicion first arose . he was dining with the randalls family , and jane , at the eltons \\'; and he had seen a look , more than a single look , at miss fairfax , which , from the admirer of miss woodhouse , seemed somewhat out of place . when he was again in their company , he could not help remembering what he had seen ; nor could he avoid observations which , unless it were like cowper and his fire at twilight , \" myself creating what i saw ,\" brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking , of private understanding even , between frank churchill and jane . he had walked up one day after dinner , as he very often did , to spend his evening at hartfield . emma and harriet were going to walk ; he joined them ; and , on returning , they fell in with a larger party , who , like themselves , judged it wisest to take their exercise early , as the weather threatened rain ; mr . and mrs . weston and their son , miss bates and her niece , who had accidentally met . they all united ; and , on reaching hartfield gates , emma , who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father , pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him . the randalls party agreed to it immediately ; and after a pretty long speech from miss bates , which few persons listened to , she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouse \\' s most obliging invitation . as they were turning into the grounds , mr . perry passed by on horseback . the gentlemen spoke of his horse . \" by the bye ,\" said frank churchill to mrs . weston presently , \" what became of mr . perry \\' s plan of setting up his carriage ?\" mrs . weston looked surprized , and said , \" i did not know that he ever had any such plan .\" \" nay , i had it from you . you wrote me word of it three months ago .\" \" me ! impossible !\" \" indeed you did . i remember it perfectly . you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon . mrs . perry had told somebody , and was extremely happy about it . it was owing to _her_ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm . you must remember it now ?\" \" upon my word i never heard of it till this moment .\" \" never ! really , never !-- bless me ! how could it be ?-- then i must have dreamt it -- but i was completely persuaded -- miss smith , you walk as if you were tired . you will not be sorry to find yourself at home .\" \" what is this ?-- what is this ?\" cried mr . weston , \" about perry and a carriage ? is perry going to set up his carriage , frank ? i am glad he can afford it . you had it from himself , had you ?\" \" no , sir ,\" replied his son , laughing , \" i seem to have had it from nobody .-- very odd !-- i really was persuaded of mrs . weston \\' s having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe , many weeks ago , with all these particulars -- but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before , of course it must have been a dream . i am a great dreamer . i dream of every body at highbury when i am away -- and when i have gone through my particular friends , then i begin dreaming of mr . and mrs . perry .\" \" it is odd though ,\" observed his father , \" that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe . perry \\' s setting up his carriage ! and his wife \\' s persuading him to it , out of care for his health -- just what will happen , i have no doubt , some time or other ; only a little premature . what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream ! and at others , what a heap of absurdities it is ! well , frank , your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent . emma , you are a great dreamer , i think ?\" emma was out of hearing . she had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance , and was beyond the reach of mr . weston \\' s hint . \" why , to own the truth ,\" cried miss bates , who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes , \" if i must speak on this subject , there is no denying that mr . frank churchill might have -- i do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if i am questioned about it , i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for mrs . perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days . mrs . perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed . jane , don \\' t you remember grandmama \\' s telling us of it when we got home ? i forget where we had been walking to -- very likely to randalls ; yes , i think it was to randalls . mrs . perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed i do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of . at the same time , i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware . i am a talker , you know ; i am rather a talker ; and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not . i am not like jane ; i wish i were . i will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world . where is she ?-- oh ! just behind . perfectly remember mrs . perry \\' s coming .-- extraordinary dream , indeed !\" they were entering the hall . mr . knightley \\' s eyes had preceded miss bates \\' s in a glance at jane . from frank churchill \\' s face , where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away , he had involuntarily turned to hers ; but she was indeed behind , and too busy with her shawl . mr . weston had walked in . the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass . mr . knightley suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye -- he seemed watching her intently -- in vain , however , if it were so -- jane passed between them into the hall , and looked at neither . there was no time for farther remark or explanation . the dream must be borne with , and mr . knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield , and which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use , instead of the small - sized pembroke , on which two of his daily meals had , for forty years been crowded . tea passed pleasantly , and nobody seemed in a hurry to move . \" miss woodhouse ,\" said frank churchill , after examining a table behind him , which he could reach as he sat , \" have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ? it used to stand here . where is it ? this is a sort of dull - looking evening , that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer . we had great amusement with those letters one morning . i want to puzzle you again .\" emma was pleased with the thought ; and producing the box , the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets , which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves . they were rapidly forming words for each other , or for any body else who would be puzzled . the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for mr . woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which mr . weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the \" poor little boys ,\" or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully emma had written it . frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax . she gave a slight glance round the table , and applied herself to it . frank was next to emma , jane opposite to them -- and mr . knightley so placed as to see them all ; and it was his object to see as much as he could , with as little apparent observation . the word was discovered , and with a faint smile pushed away . if meant to be immediately mixed with the others , and buried from sight , she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across , for it was not mixed ; and harriet , eager after every fresh word , and finding out none , directly took it up , and fell to work . she was sitting by mr . knightley , and turned to him for help . the word was _blunder_ ; and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it , there was a blush on jane \\' s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible . mr . knightley connected it with the dream ; but how it could all be , was beyond his comprehension . how the delicacy , the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep ! he feared there must be some decided involvement . disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn . these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick . it was a child \\' s play , chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank churchill \\' s part . with great indignation did he continue to observe him ; with great alarm and distrust , to observe also his two blinded companions . he saw a short word prepared for emma , and given to her with a look sly and demure . he saw that emma had soon made it out , and found it highly entertaining , though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure ; for she said , \" nonsense ! for shame !\" he heard frank churchill next say , with a glance towards jane , \" i will give it to her -- shall i ?\"-- and as clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth . \" no , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed .\" it was done however . this gallant young man , who seemed to love without feeling , and to recommend himself without complaisance , directly handed over the word to miss fairfax , and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it . mr . knightley \\' s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be , made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it , and it was not long before he saw it to be _dixon_ . jane fairfax \\' s perception seemed to accompany his ; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters so arranged . she was evidently displeased ; looked up , and seeing herself watched , blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her , and saying only , \" i did not know that proper names were allowed ,\" pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit , and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered . her face was averted from those who had made the attack , and turned towards her aunt . \" aye , very true , my dear ,\" cried the latter , though jane had not spoken a word --\" i was just going to say the same thing . it is time for us to be going indeed . the evening is closing in , and grandmama will be looking for us . my dear sir , you are too obliging . we really must wish you good night .\" jane \\' s alertness in moving , proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived . she was immediately up , and wanting to quit the table ; but so many were also moving , that she could not get away ; and mr . knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her , and resolutely swept away by her unexamined . she was afterwards looking for her shawl -- frank churchill was looking also -- it was growing dusk , and the room was in confusion ; and how they parted , mr . knightley could not tell . he remained at hartfield after all the rest , his thoughts full of what he had seen ; so full , that when the candles came to assist his observations , he must -- yes , he certainly must , as a friend -- an anxious friend -- give emma some hint , ask her some question . he could not see her in a situation of such danger , without trying to preserve her . it was his duty . \" pray , emma ,\" said he , \" may i ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax ? i saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other .\" emma was extremely confused . she could not endure to give him the true explanation ; for though her suspicions were by no means removed , she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them . \" oh !\" she cried in evident embarrassment , \" it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves .\" \" the joke ,\" he replied gravely , \" seemed confined to you and mr . churchill .\" he had hoped she would speak again , but she did not . she would rather busy herself about any thing than speak . he sat a little while in doubt . a variety of evils crossed his mind . interference -- fruitless interference . emma \\' s confusion , and the acknowledged intimacy , seemed to declare her affection engaged . yet he would speak . he owed it to her , to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference , rather than her welfare ; to encounter any thing , rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause . \" my dear emma ,\" said he at last , with earnest kindness , \" do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ?\" \" between mr . frank churchill and miss fairfax ? oh ! yes , perfectly .-- why do you make a doubt of it ?\" \" have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ?\" \" never , never !\" she cried with a most open eagerness --\" never , for the twentieth part of a moment , did such an idea occur to me . and how could it possibly come into your head ?\" \" i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them -- certain expressive looks , which i did not believe meant to be public .\" \" oh ! you amuse me excessively . i am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do -- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do . there is no admiration between them , i do assure you ; and the appearances which have caught you , have arisen from some peculiar circumstances -- feelings rather of a totally different nature -- it is impossible exactly to explain :-- there is a good deal of nonsense in it -- but the part which is capable of being communicated , which is sense , is , that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another , as any two beings in the world can be . that is , i _presume_ it to be so on her side , and i can _answer_ for its being so on his . i will answer for the gentleman \\' s indifference .\" she spoke with a confidence which staggered , with a satisfaction which silenced , mr . knightley . she was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described , and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her : but his gaiety did not meet hers . he found he could not be useful , and his feelings were too much irritated for talking . that he might not be irritated into an absolute fever , by the fire which mr . woodhouse \\' s tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year , he soon afterwards took a hasty leave , and walked home to the coolness and solitude of donwell abbey . chapter vi after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr . and mrs . suckling , the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn . no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present . in the daily interchange of news , they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings \\' coming had been united , such as the last accounts of mrs . churchill , whose health seemed every day to supply a different report , and the situation of mrs . weston , whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child , as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it . mrs . elton was very much disappointed . it was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade . her introductions and recommendations must all wait , and every projected party be still only talked of . so she thought at first ;-- but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off . why should not they explore to box hill though the sucklings did not come ? they could go there again with them in the autumn . it was settled that they should go to box hill . that there was to be such a party had been long generally known : it had even given the idea of another . emma had never been to box hill ; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing , and she and mr . weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither . two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them , and it was to be done in a quiet , unpretending , elegant way , infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation , the regular eating and drinking , and picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings . this was so very well understood between them , that emma could not but feel some surprise , and a little displeasure , on hearing from mr . weston that he had been proposing to mrs . elton , as her brother and sister had failed her , that the two parties should unite , and go together ; and that as mrs . elton had very readily acceded to it , so it was to be , if she had no objection . now , as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs . elton , of which mr . weston must already be perfectly aware , it was not worth bringing forward again :-- it could not be done without a reproof to him , which would be giving pain to his wife ; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid ; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of mrs . elton \\' s party ! every feeling was offended ; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr . weston \\' s temper . \" i am glad you approve of what i have done ,\" said he very comfortably . \" but i thought you would . such schemes as these are nothing without numbers . one cannot have too large a party . a large party secures its own amusement . and she is a good - natured woman after all . one could not leave her out .\" emma denied none of it aloud , and agreed to none of it in private . it was now the middle of june , and the weather fine ; and mrs . elton was growing impatient to name the day , and settle with mr . weston as to pigeon - pies and cold lamb , when a lame carriage - horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty . it might be weeks , it might be only a few days , before the horse were useable ; but no preparations could be ventured on , and it was all melancholy stagnation . mrs . elton \\' s resources were inadequate to such an attack . \" is not this most vexations , knightley ?\" she cried .--\" and such weather for exploring !-- these delays and disappointments are quite odious . what are we to do ?-- the year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done . before this time last year i assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from maple grove to kings weston .\" \" you had better explore to donwell ,\" replied mr . knightley . \" that may be done without horses . come , and eat my strawberries . they are ripening fast .\" if mr . knightley did not begin seriously , he was obliged to proceed so , for his proposal was caught at with delight ; and the \" oh ! i should like it of all things ,\" was not plainer in words than manner . donwell was famous for its strawberry - beds , which seemed a plea for the invitation : but no plea was necessary ; cabbage - beds would have been enough to tempt the lady , who only wanted to be going somewhere . she promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it . \" you may depend upon me ,\" said she . \" i certainly will come . name your day , and i will come . you will allow me to bring jane fairfax ?\" \" i cannot name a day ,\" said he , \" till i have spoken to some others whom i would wish to meet you .\" \" oh ! leave all that to me . only give me a carte - blanche .-- i am lady patroness , you know . it is my party . i will bring friends with me .\" \" i hope you will bring elton ,\" said he : \" but i will not trouble you to give any other invitations .\" \" oh ! now you are looking very sly . but consider -- you need not be afraid of delegating power to _me_ . i am no young lady on her preferment . married women , you know , may be safely authorised . it is my party . leave it all to me . i will invite your guests .\" \" no ,\"-- he calmly replied ,--\" there is but one married woman in the world whom i can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell , and that one is --\" \"-- mrs . weston , i suppose ,\" interrupted mrs . elton , rather mortified . \" no -- mrs . knightley ;-- and till she is in being , i will manage such matters myself .\" \" ah ! you are an odd creature !\" she cried , satisfied to have no one preferred to herself .--\" you are a humourist , and may say what you like . quite a humourist . well , i shall bring jane with me -- jane and her aunt .-- the rest i leave to you . i have no objections at all to meeting the hartfield family . don \\' t scruple . i know you are attached to them .\" \" you certainly will meet them if i can prevail ; and i shall call on miss bates in my way home .\" \" that \\' s quite unnecessary ; i see jane every day :-- but as you like . it is to be a morning scheme , you know , knightley ; quite a simple thing . i shall wear a large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm . here ,-- probably this basket with pink ribbon . nothing can be more simple , you see . and jane will have such another . there is to be no form or parade -- a sort of gipsy party . we are to walk about your gardens , and gather the strawberries ourselves , and sit under trees ;-- and whatever else you may like to provide , it is to be all out of doors -- a table spread in the shade , you know . every thing as natural and simple as possible . is not that your idea ?\" \" not quite . my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room . the nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies , with their servants and furniture , i think is best observed by meals within doors . when you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house .\" \" well -- as you please ; only don \\' t have a great set out . and , by the bye , can i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion ?-- pray be sincere , knightley . if you wish me to talk to mrs . hodges , or to inspect anything --\" \" i have not the least wish for it , i thank you .\" \" well -- but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever .\" \" i will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body \\' s assistance .\" \" i wish we had a donkey . the thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , jane , miss bates , and me -- and my caro sposo walking by . i really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey . in a country life i conceive it to be a sort of necessary ; for , let a woman have ever so many resources , it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home ;-- and very long walks , you know -- in summer there is dust , and in winter there is dirt .\" \" you will not find either , between donwell and highbury . donwell lane is never dusty , and now it is perfectly dry . come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it . you can borrow mrs . cole \\' s . i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible .\" \" that i am sure you would . indeed i do you justice , my good friend . under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , i know you have the warmest heart . as i tell mr . e ., you are a thorough humourist .-- yes , believe me , knightley , i am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme . you have hit upon the very thing to please me .\" mr . knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade . he wished to persuade mr . woodhouse , as well as emma , to join the party ; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill . mr . woodhouse must not , under the specious pretence of a morning drive , and an hour or two spent at donwell , be tempted away to his misery . he was invited on good faith . no lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity . he did consent . he had not been at donwell for two years . \" some very fine morning , he , and emma , and harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with mrs . weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens . he did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day . he should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet mr . and mrs . elton , and any other of his neighbours .-- he could not see any objection at all to his , and emma \\' s , and harriet \\' s going there some very fine morning . he thought it very well done of mr . knightley to invite them -- very kind and sensible -- much cleverer than dining out .-- he was not fond of dining out .\" mr . knightley was fortunate in every body \\' s most ready concurrence . the invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like mrs . elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves .-- emma and harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and mr . weston , unasked , promised to get frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with .-- mr . knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and mr . weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come . in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast , that the party to box hill was again under happy consideration ; and at last donwell was settled for one day , and box hill for the next ,-- the weather appearing exactly right . under a bright mid - day sun , at almost midsummer , mr . woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage , with one window down , to partake of this al - fresco party ; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the abbey , especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning , he was happily placed , quite at his ease , ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved , and advise every body to come and sit down , and not to heat themselves .-- mrs . weston , who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired , and sit all the time with him , remained , when all the others were invited or persuaded out , his patient listener and sympathiser . it was so long since emma had been at the abbey , that as soon as she was satisfied of her father \\' s comfort , she was glad to leave him , and look around her ; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation , more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family . she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building , its suitable , becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered -- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream , of which the abbey , with all the old neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up .-- the house was larger than hartfield , and totally unlike it , covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular , with many comfortable , and one or two handsome rooms .-- it was just what it ought to be , and it looked what it was -- and emma felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence of a family of such true gentility , untainted in blood and understanding .-- some faults of temper john knightley had ; but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably . she had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush . these were pleasant feelings , and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did , and collect round the strawberry - beds .-- the whole party were assembled , excepting frank churchill , who was expected every moment from richmond ; and mrs . elton , in all her apparatus of happiness , her large bonnet and her basket , was very ready to lead the way in gathering , accepting , or talking -- strawberries , and only strawberries , could now be thought or spoken of .--\" the best fruit in england -- every body \\' s favourite -- always wholesome .-- these the finest beds and finest sorts .-- delightful to gather for one \\' s self -- the only way of really enjoying them .-- morning decidedly the best time -- never tired -- every sort good -- hautboy infinitely superior -- no comparison -- the others hardly eatable -- hautboys very scarce -- chili preferred -- white wood finest flavour of all -- price of strawberries in london -- abundance about bristol -- maple grove -- cultivation -- beds when to be renewed -- gardeners thinking exactly different -- no general rule -- gardeners never to be put out of their way -- delicious fruit -- only too rich to be eaten much of -- inferior to cherries -- currants more refreshing -- only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping -- glaring sun -- tired to death -- could bear it no longer -- must go and sit in the shade .\" such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by mrs . weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son - in - law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy .-- she had some fears of his horse . seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now emma was obliged to overhear what mrs . elton and jane fairfax were talking of .-- a situation , a most desirable situation , was in question . mrs . elton had received notice of it that morning , and was in raptures . it was not with mrs . suckling , it was not with mrs . bragge , but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them : it was with a cousin of mrs . bragge , an acquaintance of mrs . suckling , a lady known at maple grove . delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and mrs . elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately .-- on her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend \\' s negative , though miss fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before .-- still mrs . elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow \\' s post .-- how jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to emma .-- she did look vexed , she did speak pointedly -- and at last , with a decision of action unusual to her , proposed a removal .-- \" should not they walk ? would not mr . knightley shew them the gardens -- all the gardens ?-- she wished to see the whole extent .\"-- the pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear . it was hot ; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered , dispersed way , scarcely any three together , they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes , which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river , seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds .-- it led to nothing ; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars , which seemed intended , in their erection , to give the appearance of an approach to the house , which never had been there . disputable , however , as might be the taste of such a termination , it was in itself a charming walk , and the view which closed it extremely pretty .-- the considerable slope , at nearly the foot of which the abbey stood , gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds ; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur , well clothed with wood ;-- and at the bottom of this bank , favourably placed and sheltered , rose the abbey mill farm , with meadows in front , and the river making a close and handsome curve around it . it was a sweet view -- sweet to the eye and the mind . english verdure , english culture , english comfort , seen under a sun bright , without being oppressive . in this walk emma and mr . weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived mr . knightley and harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way . mr . knightley and harriet !-- it was an odd tete - a - tete ; but she was glad to see it .-- there had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion , and turned from her with little ceremony . now they seemed in pleasant conversation . there had been a time also when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot so favourable for the abbey mill farm ; but now she feared it not . it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty , its rich pastures , spreading flocks , orchard in blossom , and light column of smoke ascending .-- she joined them at the wall , and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around . he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture , etc . and emma received a smile which seemed to say , \" these are my own concerns . i have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing robert martin .\"-- she did not suspect him . it was too old a story .-- robert martin had probably ceased to think of harriet .-- they took a few turns together along the walk .-- the shade was most refreshing , and emma found it the pleasantest part of the day . the next remove was to the house ; they must all go in and eat ;-- and they were all seated and busy , and still frank churchill did not come . mrs . weston looked , and looked in vain . his father would not own himself uneasy , and laughed at her fears ; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare . he had expressed himself as to coming , with more than common certainty . \" his aunt was so much better , that he had not a doubt of getting over to them .\"-- mrs . churchill \\' s state , however , as many were ready to remind her , was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence -- and mrs . weston was at last persuaded to believe , or to say , that it must be by some attack of mrs . churchill that he was prevented coming .-- emma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration ; she behaved very well , and betrayed no emotion . the cold repast was over , and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen , the old abbey fish - ponds ; perhaps get as far as the clover , which was to be begun cutting on the morrow , or , at any rate , have the pleasure of being hot , and growing cool again .-- mr . woodhouse , who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens , where no damps from the river were imagined even by him , stirred no more ; and his daughter resolved to remain with him , that mrs . weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need . mr . knightley had done all in his power for mr . woodhouse \\' s entertainment . books of engravings , drawers of medals , cameos , corals , shells , and every other family collection within his cabinets , had been prepared for his old friend , to while away the morning ; and the kindness had perfectly answered . mr . woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused . mrs . weston had been shewing them all to him , and now he would shew them all to emma ;-- fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child , than in a total want of taste for what he saw , for he was slow , constant , and methodical .-- before this second looking over was begun , however , emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments \\' free observation of the entrance and ground - plot of the house -- and was hardly there , when jane fairfax appeared , coming quickly in from the garden , and with a look of escape .-- little expecting to meet miss woodhouse so soon , there was a start at first ; but miss woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of . \" will you be so kind ,\" said she , \" when i am missed , as to say that i am gone home ?-- i am going this moment .-- my aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent -- but i am sure we shall be wanted , and i am determined to go directly .-- i have said nothing about it to any body . it would only be giving trouble and distress . some are gone to the ponds , and some to the lime walk . till they all come in i shall not be missed ; and when they do , will you have the goodness to say that i am gone ?\" \" certainly , if you wish it ;-- but you are not going to walk to highbury alone ?\" \" yes -- what should hurt me ?-- i walk fast . i shall be at home in twenty minutes .\" \" but it is too far , indeed it is , to be walking quite alone . let my father \\' s servant go with you .-- let me order the carriage . it can be round in five minutes .\" \" thank you , thank you -- but on no account .-- i would rather walk .-- and for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone !-- i , who may so soon have to guard others !\" she spoke with great agitation ; and emma very feelingly replied , \" that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now . i must order the carriage . the heat even would be danger .-- you are fatigued already .\" \" i am ,\"-- she answered --\" i am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue -- quick walking will refresh me .-- miss woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits . mine , i confess , are exhausted . the greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that i am gone when it is necessary .\" emma had not another word to oppose . she saw it all ; and entering into her feelings , promoted her quitting the house immediately , and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend . her parting look was grateful -- and her parting words , \" oh ! miss woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone !\"-- seemed to burst from an overcharged heart , and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her , even towards some of those who loved her best . \" such a home , indeed ! such an aunt !\" said emma , as she turned back into the hall again . \" i do pity you . and the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more i shall like you .\" jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of st . mark \\' s place , venice , when frank churchill entered the room . emma had not been thinking of him , she had forgotten to think of him -- but she was very glad to see him . mrs . weston would be at ease . the black mare was blameless ; _they_ were right who had named mrs . churchill as the cause . he had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her ; a nervous seizure , which had lasted some hours -- and he had quite given up every thought of coming , till very late ;-- and had he known how hot a ride he should have , and how late , with all his hurry , he must be , he believed he should not have come at all . the heat was excessive ; he had never suffered any thing like it -- almost wished he had staid at home -- nothing killed him like heat -- he could bear any degree of cold , etc ., but heat was intolerable -- and he sat down , at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of mr . woodhouse \\' s fire , looking very deplorable . \" you will soon be cooler , if you sit still ,\" said emma . \" as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again . i could very ill be spared -- but such a point had been made of my coming ! you will all be going soon i suppose ; the whole party breaking up . i met _one_ as i came -- madness in such weather !-- absolute madness !\" emma listened , and looked , and soon perceived that frank churchill \\' s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour . some people were always cross when they were hot . such might be his constitution ; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints , she recommended his taking some refreshment ; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining - room -- and she humanely pointed out the door . \" no -- he should not eat . he was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter .\" in two minutes , however , he relented in his own favour ; and muttering something about spruce - beer , walked off . emma returned all her attention to her father , saying in secret -- \" i am glad i have done being in love with him . i should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning . harriet \\' s sweet easy temper will not mind it .\" he was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal , and came back all the better -- grown quite cool -- and , with good manners , like himself -- able to draw a chair close to them , take an interest in their employment ; and regret , in a reasonable way , that he should be so late . he was not in his best spirits , but seemed trying to improve them ; and , at last , made himself talk nonsense very agreeably . they were looking over views in swisserland . \" as soon as my aunt gets well , i shall go abroad ,\" said he . \" i shall never be easy till i have seen some of these places . you will have my sketches , some time or other , to look at -- or my tour to read -- or my poem . i shall do something to expose myself .\" \" that may be -- but not by sketches in swisserland . you will never go to swisserland . your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave england .\" \" they may be induced to go too . a warm climate may be prescribed for her . i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad . i assure you i have . i feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that i shall soon be abroad . i ought to travel . i am tired of doing nothing . i want a change . i am serious , miss woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy -- i am sick of england -- and would leave it to - morrow , if i could .\" \" you are sick of prosperity and indulgence . cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented to stay ?\" \" _i_ sick of prosperity and indulgence ! you are quite mistaken . i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged . i am thwarted in every thing material . i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person .\" \" you are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came . go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well . another slice of cold meat , another draught of madeira and water , will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us .\" \" no -- i shall not stir . i shall sit by you . you are my best cure .\" \" we are going to box hill to - morrow ;-- you will join us . it is not swisserland , but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change . you will stay , and go with us ?\" \" no , certainly not ; i shall go home in the cool of the evening .\" \" but you may come again in the cool of to - morrow morning .\" \" no -- it will not be worth while . if i come , i shall be cross .\" \" then pray stay at richmond .\" \" but if i do , i shall be crosser still . i can never bear to think of you all there without me .\" \" these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself . chuse your own degree of crossness . i shall press you no more .\" the rest of the party were now returning , and all were soon collected . with some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill ; others took it very composedly ; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on miss fairfax \\' s disappearance being explained . that it was time for every body to go , concluded the subject ; and with a short final arrangement for the next day \\' s scheme , they parted . frank churchill \\' s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much , that his last words to emma were , \" well ;-- if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party , i will .\" she smiled her acceptance ; and nothing less than a summons from richmond was to take him back before the following evening . chapter vii they had a very fine day for box hill ; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement , accommodation , and punctuality , were in favour of a pleasant party . mr . weston directed the whole , officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage , and every body was in good time . emma and harriet went together ; miss bates and her niece , with the eltons ; the gentlemen on horseback . mrs . weston remained with mr . woodhouse . nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there . seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment , and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving ; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency . there was a languor , a want of spirits , a want of union , which could not be got over . they separated too much into parties . the eltons walked together ; mr . knightley took charge of miss bates and jane ; and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill . and mr . weston tried , in vain , to make them harmonise better . it seemed at first an accidental division , but it never materially varied . mr . and mrs . elton , indeed , shewed no unwillingness to mix , and be as agreeable as they could ; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill , there seemed a principle of separation , between the other parties , too strong for any fine prospects , or any cold collation , or any cheerful mr . weston , to remove . at first it was downright dulness to emma . she had never seen frank churchill so silent and stupid . he said nothing worth hearing -- looked without seeing -- admired without intelligence -- listened without knowing what she said . while he was so dull , it was no wonder that harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both insufferable . when they all sat down it was better ; to her taste a great deal better , for frank churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his first object . every distinguishing attention that could be paid , was paid to her . to amuse her , and be agreeable in her eyes , seemed all that he cared for -- and emma , glad to be enlivened , not sorry to be flattered , was gay and easy too , and gave him all the friendly encouragement , the admission to be gallant , which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance ; but which now , in her own estimation , meant nothing , though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english word but flirtation could very well describe . \" mr . frank churchill and miss woodhouse flirted together excessively .\" they were laying themselves open to that very phrase -- and to having it sent off in a letter to maple grove by one lady , to ireland by another . not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity ; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected . she laughed because she was disappointed ; and though she liked him for his attentions , and thought them all , whether in friendship , admiration , or playfulness , extremely judicious , they were not winning back her heart . she still intended him for her friend . \" how much i am obliged to you ,\" said he , \" for telling me to come to - day !-- if it had not been for you , i should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party . i had quite determined to go away again .\" \" yes , you were very cross ; and i do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries . i was a kinder friend than you deserved . but you were humble . you begged hard to be commanded to come .\" \" don \\' t say i was cross . i was fatigued . the heat overcame me .\" \" it is hotter to - day .\" \" not to my feelings . i am perfectly comfortable to - day .\" \" you are comfortable because you are under command .\" \" your command ?-- yes .\" \" perhaps i intended you to say so , but i meant self - command . you had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again -- and as i cannot be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine .\" \" it comes to the same thing . i can have no self - command without a motive . you order me , whether you speak or not . and you can be always with me . you are always with me .\" \" dating from three o \\' clock yesterday . my perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before .\" \" three o \\' clock yesterday ! that is your date . i thought i had seen you first in february .\" \" your gallantry is really unanswerable . but ( lowering her voice )-- nobody speaks except ourselves , and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people .\" \" i say nothing of which i am ashamed ,\" replied he , with lively impudence . \" i saw you first in february . let every body on the hill hear me if they can . let my accents swell to mickleham on one side , and dorking on the other . i saw you first in february .\" and then whispering -- \" our companions are excessively stupid . what shall we do to rouse them ? any nonsense will serve . they _shall_ talk . ladies and gentlemen , i am ordered by miss woodhouse ( who , wherever she is , presides ) to say , that she desires to know what you are all thinking of ?\" some laughed , and answered good - humouredly . miss bates said a great deal ; mrs . elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouse \\' s presiding ; mr . knightley \\' s answer was the most distinct . \" is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ?\" \" oh ! no , no \"-- cried emma , laughing as carelessly as she could -- \" upon no account in the world . it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now . let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of . i will not say quite all . there are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at mr . weston and harriet ,) whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing .\" \" it is a sort of thing ,\" cried mrs . elton emphatically , \" which _i_ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into . though , perhaps , as the _chaperon_ of the party -- _i_ never was in any circle -- exploring parties -- young ladies -- married women --\" her mutterings were chiefly to her husband ; and he murmured , in reply , \" very true , my love , very true . exactly so , indeed -- quite unheard of -- but some ladies say any thing . better pass it off as a joke . every body knows what is due to _you_ .\" \" it will not do ,\" whispered frank to emma ; \" they are most of them affronted . i will attack them with more address . ladies and gentlemen -- i am ordered by miss woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way . here are seven of you , besides myself , ( who , she is pleased to say , am very entertaining already ,) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever , be it prose or verse , original or repeated -- or two things moderately clever -- or three things very dull indeed , and she engages to laugh heartily at them all .\" \" oh ! very well ,\" exclaimed miss bates , \" then i need not be uneasy . ` three things very dull indeed .\\' that will just do for me , you know . i shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open my mouth , shan \\' t i ? ( looking round with the most good - humoured dependence on every body \\' s assent )-- do not you all think i shall ?\" emma could not resist . \" ah ! ma \\' am , but there may be a difficulty . pardon me -- but you will be limited as to number -- only three at once .\" miss bates , deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner , did not immediately catch her meaning ; but , when it burst on her , it could not anger , though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her . \" ah !-- well -- to be sure . yes , i see what she means , ( turning to mr . knightley ,) and i will try to hold my tongue . i must make myself very disagreeable , or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend .\" \" i like your plan ,\" cried mr . weston . \" agreed , agreed . i will do my best . i am making a conundrum . how will a conundrum reckon ?\" \" low , i am afraid , sir , very low ,\" answered his son ;--\" but we shall be indulgent -- especially to any one who leads the way .\" \" no , no ,\" said emma , \" it will not reckon low . a conundrum of mr . weston \\' s shall clear him and his next neighbour . come , sir , pray let me hear it .\" \" i doubt its being very clever myself ,\" said mr . weston . \" it is too much a matter of fact , but here it is .-- what two letters of the alphabet are there , that express perfection ?\" \" what two letters !-- express perfection ! i am sure i do not know .\" \" ah ! you will never guess . you , ( to emma ), i am certain , will never guess .-- i will tell you .-- m . and a .-- em - ma .-- do you understand ?\" understanding and gratification came together . it might be a very indifferent piece of wit , but emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it -- and so did frank and harriet .-- it did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally ; some looked very stupid about it , and mr . knightley gravely said , \" this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and mr . weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else . _perfection_ should not have come quite so soon .\" \" oh ! for myself , i protest i must be excused ,\" said mrs . elton ; \" _i_ really cannot attempt -- i am not at all fond of the sort of thing . i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which i was not at all pleased with . i knew who it came from . an abominable puppy !-- you know who i mean ( nodding to her husband ). these kind of things are very well at christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer . miss woodhouse must excuse me . i am not one of those who have witty things at every body \\' s service . i do not pretend to be a wit . i have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue . pass us , if you please , mr . churchill . pass mr . e ., knightley , jane , and myself . we have nothing clever to say -- not one of us . \" yes , yes , pray pass _me_ ,\" added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; \" _i_ have nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse , or any other young lady . an old married man -- quite good for nothing . shall we walk , augusta ?\" \" with all my heart . i am really tired of exploring so long on one spot . come , jane , take my other arm .\" jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off . \" happy couple !\" said frank churchill , as soon as they were out of hearing :--\" how well they suit one another !-- very lucky -- marrying as they did , upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place !-- they only knew each other , i think , a few weeks in bath ! peculiarly lucky !-- for as to any real knowledge of a person \\' s disposition that bath , or any public place , can give -- it is all nothing ; there can be no knowledge . it is only by seeing women in their own homes , among their own set , just as they always are , that you can form any just judgment . short of that , it is all guess and luck -- and will generally be ill - luck . how many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance , and rued it all the rest of his life !\" miss fairfax , who had seldom spoken before , except among her own confederates , spoke now . \" such things do occur , undoubtedly .\"-- she was stopped by a cough . frank churchill turned towards her to listen . \" you were speaking ,\" said he , gravely . she recovered her voice . \" i was only going to observe , that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women , i cannot imagine them to be very frequent . a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise -- but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards . i would be understood to mean , that it can be only weak , irresolute characters , ( whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance ,) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience , an oppression for ever .\" he made no answer ; merely looked , and bowed in submission ; and soon afterwards said , in a lively tone , \" well , i have so little confidence in my own judgment , that whenever i marry , i hope some body will chuse my wife for me . will you ? ( turning to emma .) will you chuse a wife for me ?-- i am sure i should like any body fixed on by you . you provide for the family , you know , ( with a smile at his father ). find some body for me . i am in no hurry . adopt her , educate her .\" \" and make her like myself .\" \" by all means , if you can .\" \" very well . i undertake the commission . you shall have a charming wife .\" \" she must be very lively , and have hazle eyes . i care for nothing else . i shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when i return , i shall come to you for my wife . remember .\" emma was in no danger of forgetting . it was a commission to touch every favourite feeling . would not harriet be the very creature described ? hazle eyes excepted , two years more might make her all that he wished . he might even have harriet in his thoughts at the moment ; who could say ? referring the education to her seemed to imply it . \" now , ma \\' am ,\" said jane to her aunt , \" shall we join mrs . elton ?\" \" if you please , my dear . with all my heart . i am quite ready . i was ready to have gone with her , but this will do just as well . we shall soon overtake her . there she is -- no , that \\' s somebody else . that \\' s one of the ladies in the irish car party , not at all like her .-- well , i declare --\" they walked off , followed in half a minute by mr . knightley . mr . weston , his son , emma , and harriet , only remained ; and the young man \\' s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant . even emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment , and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others , or sitting almost alone , and quite unattended to , in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her . the appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight ; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart , and the solicitude of mrs . elton to have _her_ carriage first , were gladly endured , in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure . such another scheme , composed of so many ill - assorted people , she hoped never to be betrayed into again . while waiting for the carriage , she found mr . knightley by her side . he looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said , \" emma , i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do : a privilege rather endured than allowed , perhaps , but i must still use it . i cannot see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance . how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates ? how could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character , age , and situation ?-- emma , i had not thought it possible .\" emma recollected , blushed , was sorry , but tried to laugh it off . \" nay , how could i help saying what i did ?-- nobody could have helped it . it was not so very bad . i dare say she did not understand me .\" \" i assure you she did . she felt your full meaning . she has talked of it since . i wish you could have heard how she talked of it -- with what candour and generosity . i wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father , when her society must be so irksome .\" \" oh !\" cried emma , \" i know there is not a better creature in the world : but you must allow , that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her .\" \" they are blended ,\" said he , \" i acknowledge ; and , were she prosperous , i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good . were she a woman of fortune , i would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance , i would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner . were she your equal in situation -- but , emma , consider how far this is from being the case . she is poor ; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to ; and , if she live to old age , must probably sink more . her situation should secure your compassion . it was badly done , indeed ! you , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _some_ ,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her .-- this is not pleasant to you , emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but i must , i will ,-- i will tell you truths while i can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now .\" while they talked , they were advancing towards the carriage ; it was ready ; and , before she could speak again , he had handed her in . he had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted , and her tongue motionless . they were combined only of anger against herself , mortification , and deep concern . she had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late . he had turned away , and the horses were in motion . she continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed , they were half way down the hill , and every thing left far behind . she was vexed beyond what could have been expressed -- almost beyond what she could conceal . never had she felt so agitated , mortified , grieved , at any circumstance in her life . she was most forcibly struck . the truth of this representation there was no denying . she felt it at her heart . how could she have been so brutal , so cruel to miss bates ! how could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued ! and how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude , of concurrence , of common kindness ! time did not compose her . as she reflected more , she seemed but to feel it more . she never had been so depressed . happily it was not necessary to speak . there was only harriet , who seemed not in spirits herself , fagged , and very willing to be silent ; and emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home , without being at any trouble to check them , extraordinary as they were . chapter viii the wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emma \\' s thoughts all the evening . how it might be considered by the rest of the party , she could not tell . they , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed . a whole evening of back - gammon with her father , was felicity to it . _there_ , indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty - four to his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem , she could not , in her general conduct , be open to any severe reproach . as a daughter , she hoped she was not without a heart . she hoped no one could have said to her , \" how could you be so unfeeling to your father ?-- i must , i will tell you truths while i can .\" miss bates should never again -- no , never ! if attention , in future , could do away the past , she might hope to be forgiven . she had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious . but it should be so no more . in the warmth of true contrition , she would call upon her the very next morning , and it should be the beginning , on her side , of a regular , equal , kindly intercourse . she was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her . it was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see mr . knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit . she had no objection . she would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence , so justly and truly hers . her eyes were towards donwell as she walked , but she saw him not . \" the ladies were all at home .\" she had never rejoiced at the sound before , nor ever before entered the passage , nor walked up the stairs , with any wish of giving pleasure , but in conferring obligation , or of deriving it , except in subsequent ridicule . there was a bustle on her approach ; a good deal of moving and talking . she heard miss bates \\' s voice , something was to be done in a hurry ; the maid looked frightened and awkward ; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment , and then ushered her in too soon . the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room . jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard miss bates saying , \" well , my dear , i shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed , and i am sure you are ill enough .\" poor old mrs . bates , civil and humble as usual , looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on . \" i am afraid jane is not very well ,\" said she , \" but i do not know ; they _tell_ me she is well . i dare say my daughter will be here presently , miss woodhouse . i hope you find a chair . i wish hetty had not gone . i am very little able -- have you a chair , ma \\' am ? do you sit where you like ? i am sure she will be here presently .\" emma seriously hoped she would . she had a moment \\' s fear of miss bates keeping away from her . but miss bates soon came --\" very happy and obliged \"-- but emma \\' s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before -- less ease of look and manner . a very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax , she hoped , might lead the way to a return of old feelings . the touch seemed immediate . \" ah ! miss woodhouse , how kind you are !-- i suppose you have heard -- and are come to give us joy . this does not seem much like joy , indeed , in me --( twinkling away a tear or two )-- but it will be very trying for us to part with her , after having had her so long , and she has a dreadful headache just now , writing all the morning :-- such long letters , you know , to be written to colonel campbell , and mrs . dixon . ` my dear ,\\' said i , ` you will blind yourself \\'-- for tears were in her eyes perpetually . one cannot wonder , one cannot wonder . it is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate -- such a situation , i suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful , miss woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune --( again dispersing her tears )-- but , poor dear soul ! if you were to see what a headache she has . when one is in great pain , you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve . she is as low as possible . to look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation . you will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room -- i want her to lie down upon the bed . ` my dear ,\\' said i , ` i shall say you are laid down upon the bed :\\' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room . but , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well . she will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , miss woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her . you were kept waiting at the door -- i was quite ashamed -- but somehow there was a little bustle -- for it so happened that we had not heard the knock , and till you were on the stairs , we did not know any body was coming . ` it is only mrs . cole ,\\' said i , ` depend upon it . nobody else would come so early .\\' ` well ,\\' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now .\\' but then patty came in , and said it was you . ` oh !\\' said i , ` it is miss woodhouse : i am sure you will like to see her .\\'-- ` i can see nobody ,\\' said she ; and up she got , and would go away ; and that was what made us keep you waiting -- and extremely sorry and ashamed we were . ` if you must go , my dear ,\\' said i , ` you must , and i will say you are laid down upon the bed .\\'\" emma was most sincerely interested . her heart had been long growing kinder towards jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that jane might very naturally resolve on seeing mrs . cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself . she spoke as she felt , with earnest regret and solicitude -- sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually determined on , might be as much for miss fairfax \\' s advantage and comfort as possible . \" it must be a severe trial to them all . she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbell \\' s return .\" \" so very kind !\" replied miss bates . \" but you are always kind .\" there was no bearing such an \" always ;\" and to break through her dreadful gratitude , emma made the direct inquiry of -- \" where -- may i ask ?-- is miss fairfax going ?\" \" to a mrs . smallridge -- charming woman -- most superior -- to have the charge of her three little girls -- delightful children . impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort ; if we except , perhaps , mrs . suckling \\' s own family , and mrs . bragge \\' s ; but mrs . smallridge is intimate with both , and in the very same neighbourhood :-- lives only four miles from maple grove . jane will be only four miles from maple grove .\" \" mrs . elton , i suppose , has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes --\" \" yes , our good mrs . elton . the most indefatigable , true friend . she would not take a denial . she would not let jane say , ` no ;\\' for when jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at donwell ,) when jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbell \\' s return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told mrs . elton over and over again -- and i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mind !-- but that good mrs . elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than i did . it is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did , and refuse to take jane \\' s answer ; but she positively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday , as jane wished her ; she would wait -- and , sure enough , yesterday evening it was all settled that jane should go . quite a surprize to me ! i had not the least idea !-- jane took mrs . elton aside , and told her at once , that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs . smallridge \\' s situation , she had come to the resolution of accepting it .-- i did not know a word of it till it was all settled .\" \" you spent the evening with mrs . elton ?\" \" yes , all of us ; mrs . elton would have us come . it was settled so , upon the hill , while we were walking about with mr . knightley . ` you _must_ _all_ spend your evening with us ,\\' said she --` i positively must have you _all_ come .\\'\" \" mr . knightley was there too , was he ?\" \" no , not mr . knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though i thought he would come , because mrs . elton declared she would not let him off , he did not ;-- but my mother , and jane , and i , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had . such kind friends , you know , miss woodhouse , one must always find agreeable , though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning \\' s party . even pleasure , you know , is fatiguing -- and i cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it . however , _i_ shall always think it a very pleasant party , and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it .\" \" miss fairfax , i suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ?\" \" i dare say she had .\" \" whenever the time may come , it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends -- but i hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible -- i mean , as to the character and manners of the family .\" \" thank you , dear miss woodhouse . yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it . except the sucklings and bragges , there is not such another nursery establishment , so liberal and elegant , in all mrs . elton \\' s acquaintance . mrs . smallridge , a most delightful woman !-- a style of living almost equal to maple grove -- and as to the children , except the little sucklings and little bragges , there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere . jane will be treated with such regard and kindness !-- it will be nothing but pleasure , a life of pleasure .-- and her salary !-- i really cannot venture to name her salary to you , miss woodhouse . even you , used as you are to great sums , would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like jane .\" \" ah ! madam ,\" cried emma , \" if other children are at all like what i remember to have been myself , i should think five times the amount of what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions , dearly earned .\" \" you are so noble in your ideas !\" \" and when is miss fairfax to leave you ?\" \" very soon , very soon , indeed ; that \\' s the worst of it . within a fortnight . mrs . smallridge is in a great hurry . my poor mother does not know how to bear it . so then , i try to put it out of her thoughts , and say , come ma \\' am , do not let us think about it any more .\" \" her friends must all be sorry to lose her ; and will not colonel and mrs . campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return ?\" \" yes ; jane says she is sure they will ; but yet , this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining . i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs . elton , and when mrs . elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it ! it was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because i remember thinking -- oh ! no , now i recollect , now i have it ; something happened before tea , but not that . mr . elton was called out of the room before tea , old john abdy \\' s son wanted to speak with him . poor old john , i have a great regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty - seven years ; and now , poor old man , he is bed - ridden , and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints -- i must go and see him to - day ; and so will jane , i am sure , if she gets out at all . and poor john \\' s son came to talk to mr . elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he cannot keep his father without some help ; and so , when mr . elton came back , he told us what john ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr . frank churchill to richmond . that was what happened before tea . it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs . elton .\" miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her ; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of mr . frank churchill \\' s going , she proceeded to give them all , it was of no consequence . what mr . elton had learned from the ostler on the subject , being the accumulation of the ostler \\' s own knowledge , and the knowledge of the servants at randalls , was , that a messenger had come over from richmond soon after the return of the party from box hill -- which messenger , however , had been no more than was expected ; and that mr . churchill had sent his nephew a few lines , containing , upon the whole , a tolerable account of mrs . churchill , and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early ; but that mr . frank churchill having resolved to go home directly , without waiting at all , and his horse seeming to have got a cold , tom had been sent off immediately for the crown chaise , and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by , the boy going a good pace , and driving very steady . there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest , and it caught emma \\' s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind . the contrast between mrs . churchill \\' s importance in the world , and jane fairfax \\' s , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of woman \\' s destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by miss bates \\' s saying , \" aye , i see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte . what is to become of that ?-- very true . poor dear jane was talking of it just now .-- ` you must go ,\\' said she . ` you and i must part . you will have no business here .-- let it stay , however ,\\' said she ; ` give it houseroom till colonel campbell comes back . i shall talk about it to him ; he will settle for me ; he will help me out of all my difficulties .\\'-- and to this day , i do believe , she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter \\' s .\" now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte ; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing , that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough ; and , with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt , took leave . chapter ix emma \\' s pensive meditations , as she walked home , were not interrupted ; but on entering the parlour , she found those who must rouse her . mr . knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence , and were sitting with her father .-- mr . knightley immediately got up , and in a manner decidedly graver than usual , said , \" i would not go away without seeing you , but i have no time to spare , and therefore must now be gone directly . i am going to london , to spend a few days with john and isabella . have you any thing to send or say , besides the ` love ,\\' which nobody carries ?\" \" nothing at all . but is not this a sudden scheme ?\" \" yes -- rather -- i have been thinking of it some little time .\" emma was sure he had not forgiven her ; he looked unlike himself . time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again . while he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going -- her father began his inquiries . \" well , my dear , and did you get there safely ?-- and how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter ?-- i dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming . dear emma has been to call on mrs . and miss bates , mr . knightley , as i told you before . she is always so attentive to them !\" emma \\' s colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at mr . knightley .-- it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour , as if his eyes received the truth from her \\' s , and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured .-- he looked at her with a glow of regard . she was warmly gratified -- and in another moment still more so , by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part .-- he took her hand ;-- whether she had not herself made the first motion , she could not say -- she might , perhaps , have rather offered it -- but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips -- when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go .-- why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done , she could not perceive .-- he would have judged better , she thought , if he had not stopped .-- the intention , however , was indubitable ; and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry , or however else it happened , but she thought nothing became him more .-- it was with him , of so simple , yet so dignified a nature .-- she could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction . it spoke such perfect amity .-- he left them immediately afterwards -- gone in a moment . he always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory , but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance . emma could not regret her having gone to miss bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier ;-- it would have been a great pleasure to talk over jane fairfax \\' s situation with mr . knightley .-- neither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square , for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed -- but it might have happened at a better time -- and to have had longer notice of it , would have been pleasanter .-- they parted thorough friends , however ; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance , and his unfinished gallantry ;-- it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion .-- he had been sitting with them half an hour , she found . it was a pity that she had not come back earlier ! in the hope of diverting her father \\' s thoughts from the disagreeableness of mr . knightley \\' s going to london ; and going so suddenly ; and going on horseback , which she knew would be all very bad ; emma communicated her news of jane fairfax , and her dependence on the effect was justified ; it supplied a very useful check ,-- interested , without disturbing him . he had long made up his mind to jane fairfax \\' s going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but mr . knightley \\' s going to london had been an unexpected blow . \" i am very glad , indeed , my dear , to hear she is to be so comfortably settled . mrs . elton is very good - natured and agreeable , and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be . i hope it is a dry situation , and that her health will be taken good care of . it ought to be a first object , as i am sure poor miss taylor \\' s always was with me . you know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us . and i hope she will be better off in one respect , and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long .\" the following day brought news from richmond to throw every thing else into the background . an express arrived at randalls to announce the death of mrs . churchill ! though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account , she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return . a sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state , had carried her off after a short struggle . the great mrs . churchill was no more . it was felt as such things must be felt . every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she would be buried . goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill - fame . mrs . churchill , after being disliked at least twenty - five years , was now spoken of with compassionate allowances . in one point she was fully justified . she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill . the event acquitted her of all the fancifulness , and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints . \" poor mrs . churchill ! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal : more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper . it was a sad event -- a great shock -- with all her faults , what would mr . churchill do without her ? mr . churchill \\' s loss would be dreadful indeed . mr . churchill would never get over it .\"-- even mr . weston shook his head , and looked solemn , and said , \" ah ! poor woman , who would have thought it !\" and resolved , that his mourning should be as handsome as possible ; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense , true and steady . how it would affect frank was among the earliest thoughts of both . it was also a very early speculation with emma . the character of mrs . churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed . she saw in a moment all the possible good . now , an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter . mr . churchill , independent of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew . all that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed . harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , with great self - command . what ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing . emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance . they spoke , therefore , of mrs . churchill \\' s death with mutual forbearance . short letters from frank were received at randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans . mr . churchill was better than could be expected ; and their first removal , on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire , was to be to the house of a very old friend in windsor , to whom mr . churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years . at present , there was nothing to be done for harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on emma \\' s side . it was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while harriet \\' s opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury , who wished to shew her kindness -- and with emma it was grown into a first wish . she had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . she wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration . she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield . a note was written to urge it . the invitation was refused , and by a verbal message . \" miss fairfax was not well enough to write ;\" and when mr . perry called at hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to mrs . smallridge \\' s at the time proposed . her health seemed for the moment completely deranged -- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , mr . perry was uneasy about her . he thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it . her spirits seemed overcome . her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder :-- confined always to one room ;-- he could have wished it otherwise -- and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description . her care and attention could not be questioned ; they were , in fact , only too great . he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more evil than good from them . emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful . to take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would name -- mentioning that she had mr . perry \\' s decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient . the answer was only in this short note : \" miss fairfax \\' s compliments and thanks , but is quite unequal to any exercise .\" emma felt that her own note had deserved something better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words , whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly , and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted . in spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to mrs . bates \\' s , in the hope that jane would be induced to join her -- but it would not do ;-- miss bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service -- and every thing that message could do was tried -- but all in vain . miss bates was obliged to return without success ; jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse .-- emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , miss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let miss woodhouse in . \" indeed , the truth was , that poor dear jane could not bear to see any body -- any body at all -- mrs . elton , indeed , could not be denied -- and mrs . cole had made such a point -- and mrs . perry had said so much -- but , except them , jane would really see nobody .\" emma did not want to be classed with the mrs . eltons , the mrs . perrys , and the mrs . coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself -- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned miss bates farther as to her niece \\' s appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist . on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; jane would hardly eat any thing :-- mr . perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful . emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note . in half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from miss bates , but \" dear jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing .\" when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , at some distance from highbury , on the afternoon of the very day on which she had , under the plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage , she could have no doubt -- putting every thing together -- that jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _her_ . she was sorry , very sorry . her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could mr . knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting jane fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove . chapter x one morning , about ten days after mrs . churchill \\' s decease , emma was called downstairs to mr . weston , who \" could not stay five minutes , and wanted particularly to speak with her .\"-- he met her at the parlour - door , and hardly asking her how she did , in the natural key of his voice , sunk it immediately , to say , unheard by her father , \" can you come to randalls at any time this morning ?-- do , if it be possible . mrs . weston wants to see you . she must see you .\" \" is she unwell ?\" \" no , no , not at all -- only a little agitated . she would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _alone_ , and that you know --( nodding towards her father )-- humph !-- can you come ?\" \" certainly . this moment , if you please . it is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way . but what can be the matter ?-- is she really not ill ?\" \" depend upon me -- but ask no more questions . you will know it all in time . the most unaccountable business ! but hush , hush !\" to guess what all this meant , was impossible even for emma . something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and mr . weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for randalls . \" now ,\"-- said emma , when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates ,-- \" now mr . weston , do let me know what has happened .\" \" no , no ,\"-- he gravely replied .--\" don \\' t ask me . i promised my wife to leave it all to her . she will break it to you better than i can . do not be impatient , emma ; it will all come out too soon .\" \" break it to me ,\" cried emma , standing still with terror .-- \" good god !-- mr . weston , tell me at once .-- something has happened in brunswick square . i know it has . tell me , i charge you tell me this moment what it is .\" \" no , indeed you are mistaken .\"-- \" mr . weston do not trifle with me .-- consider how many of my dearest friends are now in brunswick square . which of them is it ?-- i charge you by all that is sacred , not to attempt concealment .\" \" upon my word , emma .\"-- \" your word !-- why not your honour !-- why not say upon your honour , that it has nothing to do with any of them ? good heavens !-- what can be to be _broke_ to me , that does not relate to one of that family ?\" \" upon my honour ,\" said he very seriously , \" it does not . it is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of knightley .\" emma \\' s courage returned , and she walked on . \" i was wrong ,\" he continued , \" in talking of its being _broke_ to you . i should not have used the expression . in fact , it does not concern you -- it concerns only myself ,-- that is , we hope .-- humph !-- in short , my dear emma , there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it . i don \\' t say that it is not a disagreeable business -- but things might be much worse .-- if we walk fast , we shall soon be at randalls .\" emma found that she must wait ; and now it required little effort . she asked no more questions therefore , merely employed her own fancy , and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern -- something just come to light , of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family ,-- something which the late event at richmond had brought forward . her fancy was very active . half a dozen natural children , perhaps -- and poor frank cut off !-- this , though very undesirable , would be no matter of agony to her . it inspired little more than an animating curiosity . \" who is that gentleman on horseback ?\" said she , as they proceeded -- speaking more to assist mr . weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view . \" i do not know .-- one of the otways .-- not frank ;-- it is not frank , i assure you . you will not see him . he is half way to windsor by this time .\" \" has your son been with you , then ?\" \" oh ! yes -- did not you know ?-- well , well , never mind .\" for a moment he was silent ; and then added , in a tone much more guarded and demure , \" yes , frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did .\" they hurried on , and were speedily at randalls .--\" well , my dear ,\" said he , as they entered the room --\" i have brought her , and now i hope you will soon be better . i shall leave you together . there is no use in delay . i shall not be far off , if you want me .\"-- and emma distinctly heard him add , in a lower tone , before he quitted the room ,--\" i have been as good as my word . she has not the least idea .\" mrs . weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that emma \\' s uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said , \" what is it my dear friend ? something of a very unpleasant nature , i find , has occurred ;-- do let me know directly what it is . i have been walking all this way in complete suspense . we both abhor suspense . do not let mine continue longer . it will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be .\" \" have you indeed no idea ?\" said mrs . weston in a trembling voice . \" cannot you , my dear emma -- cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear ?\" \" so far as that it relates to mr . frank churchill , i do guess .\" \" you are right . it does relate to him , and i will tell you directly ;\" ( resuming her work , and seeming resolved against looking up .) \" he has been here this very morning , on a most extraordinary errand . it is impossible to express our surprize . he came to speak to his father on a subject ,-- to announce an attachment --\" she stopped to breathe . emma thought first of herself , and then of harriet . \" more than an attachment , indeed ,\" resumed mrs . weston ; \" an engagement -- a positive engagement .-- what will you say , emma -- what will any body say , when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are engaged ;-- nay , that they have been long engaged !\" emma even jumped with surprize ;-- and , horror - struck , exclaimed , \" jane fairfax !-- good god ! you are not serious ? you do not mean it ?\" \" you may well be amazed ,\" returned mrs . weston , still averting her eyes , and talking on with eagerness , that emma might have time to recover -- \" you may well be amazed . but it is even so . there has been a solemn engagement between them ever since october -- formed at weymouth , and kept a secret from every body . not a creature knowing it but themselves -- neither the campbells , nor her family , nor his .-- it is so wonderful , that though perfectly convinced of the fact , it is yet almost incredible to myself . i can hardly believe it .-- i thought i knew him .\" emma scarcely heard what was said .-- her mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about miss fairfax ; and poor harriet ;-- and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation . \" well ,\" said she at last , trying to recover herself ; \" this is a circumstance which i must think of at least half a day , before i can at all comprehend it . what !-- engaged to her all the winter -- before either of them came to highbury ?\" \" engaged since october ,-- secretly engaged .-- it has hurt me , emma , very much . it has hurt his father equally . _some_ _part_ of his conduct we cannot excuse .\" emma pondered a moment , and then replied , \" i will not pretend _not_ to understand you ; and to give you all the relief in my power , be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me , as you are apprehensive of .\" mrs . weston looked up , afraid to believe ; but emma \\' s countenance was as steady as her words . \" that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast , of my present perfect indifference ,\" she continued , \" i will farther tell you , that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance , when i did like him , when i was very much disposed to be attached to him -- nay , was attached -- and how it came to cease , is perhaps the wonder . fortunately , however , it did cease . i have really for some time past , for at least these three months , cared nothing about him . you may believe me , mrs . weston . this is the simple truth .\" mrs . weston kissed her with tears of joy ; and when she could find utterance , assured her , that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do . \" mr . weston will be almost as much relieved as myself ,\" said she . \" on this point we have been wretched . it was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other -- and we were persuaded that it was so .-- imagine what we have been feeling on your account .\" \" i have escaped ; and that i should escape , may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself . but this does not acquit _him_ , mrs . weston ; and i must say , that i think him greatly to blame . what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged , and with manners so _very_ disengaged ? what right had he to endeavour to please , as he certainly did -- to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention , as he certainly did -- while he really belonged to another ?-- how could he tell what mischief he might be doing ?-- how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him ?-- very wrong , very wrong indeed .\" \" from something that he said , my dear emma , i rather imagine --\" \" and how could _she_ bear such behaviour ! composure with a witness ! to look on , while repeated attentions were offering to another woman , before her face , and not resent it .-- that is a degree of placidity , which i can neither comprehend nor respect .\" \" there were misunderstandings between them , emma ; he said so expressly . he had not time to enter into much explanation . he was here only a quarter of an hour , and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay -- but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said . the present crisis , indeed , seemed to be brought on by them ; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct .\" \" impropriety ! oh ! mrs . weston -- it is too calm a censure . much , much beyond impropriety !-- it has sunk him , i cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion . so unlike what a man should be !-- none of that upright integrity , that strict adherence to truth and principle , that disdain of trick and littleness , which a man should display in every transaction of his life .\" \" nay , dear emma , now i must take his part ; for though he has been wrong in this instance , i have known him long enough to answer for his having many , very many , good qualities ; and --\" \" good god !\" cried emma , not attending to her .--\" mrs . smallridge , too ! jane actually on the point of going as governess ! what could he mean by such horrible indelicacy ? to suffer her to engage herself -- to suffer her even to think of such a measure !\" \" he knew nothing about it , emma . on this article i can fully acquit him . it was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction .-- till yesterday , i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans . they burst on him , i do not know how , but by some letter or message -- and it was the discovery of what she was doing , of this very project of hers , which determined him to come forward at once , own it all to his uncle , throw himself on his kindness , and , in short , put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long .\" emma began to listen better . \" i am to hear from him soon ,\" continued mrs . weston . \" he told me at parting , that he should soon write ; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now . let us wait , therefore , for this letter . it may bring many extenuations . it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood . don \\' t let us be severe , don \\' t let us be in a hurry to condemn him . let us have patience . i must love him ; and now that i am satisfied on one point , the one material point , i am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well , and ready to hope that it may . they must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment .\" \" _his_ sufferings ,\" replied emma dryly , \" do not appear to have done him much harm . well , and how did mr . churchill take it ?\" \" most favourably for his nephew -- gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty . conceive what the events of a week have done in that family ! while poor mrs . churchill lived , i suppose there could not have been a hope , a chance , a possibility ;-- but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault , than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required . what a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave !-- he gave his consent with very little persuasion .\" \" ah !\" thought emma , \" he would have done as much for harriet .\" \" this was settled last night , and frank was off with the light this morning . he stopped at highbury , at the bates \\' s , i fancy , some time -- and then came on hither ; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle , to whom he is just now more necessary than ever , that , as i tell you , he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour .-- he was very much agitated -- very much , indeed -- to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing i had ever seen him before .-- in addition to all the rest , there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell , which he had had no previous suspicion of -- and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal .\" \" and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy ?-- the campbells , the dixons , did none of them know of the engagement ?\" emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush . \" none ; not one . he positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves .\" \" well ,\" said emma , \" i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea , and i wish them very happy . but i shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding . what has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit ,-- espionage , and treachery ?-- to come among us with professions of openness and simplicity ; and such a league in secret to judge us all !-- here have we been , the whole winter and spring , completely duped , fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour , with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round , comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear .-- they must take the consequence , if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable !\" \" i am quite easy on that head ,\" replied mrs . weston . \" i am very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other , which both might not have heard .\" \" you are in luck .-- your only blunder was confined to my ear , when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady .\" \" true . but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax , i never could , under any blunder , have spoken ill of her ; and as to speaking ill of him , there i must have been safe .\" at this moment mr . weston appeared at a little distance from the window , evidently on the watch . his wife gave him a look which invited him in ; and , while he was coming round , added , \" now , dearest emma , let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease , and incline him to be satisfied with the match . let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour . it is not a connexion to gratify ; but if mr . churchill does not feel that , why should we ? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him , for frank , i mean , that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for -- and still am disposed to give her credit for , in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right . and how much may be said in her situation for even that error !\" \" much , indeed !\" cried emma feelingly . \" if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself , it is in a situation like jane fairfax \\' s .-- of such , one may almost say , that ` the world is not their \\' s , nor the world \\' s law .\\'\" she met mr . weston on his entrance , with a smiling countenance , exclaiming , \" a very pretty trick you have been playing me , upon my word ! this was a device , i suppose , to sport with my curiosity , and exercise my talent of guessing . but you really frightened me . i thought you had lost half your property , at least . and here , instead of its being a matter of condolence , it turns out to be one of congratulation .-- i congratulate you , mr . weston , with all my heart , on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter .\" a glance or two between him and his wife , convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed ; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate . his air and voice recovered their usual briskness : he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand , and entered on the subject in a manner to prove , that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing . his companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence , or smooth objections ; and by the time they had talked it all over together , and he had talked it all over again with emma , in their walk back to hartfield , he was become perfectly reconciled , and not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank could possibly have done . chapter xi \" harriet , poor harriet !\"-- those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of , and which constituted the real misery of the business to her . frank churchill had behaved very ill by herself -- very ill in many ways ,-- but it was not so much _his_ behaviour as her _own_ , which made her so angry with him . it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriet \\' s account , that gave the deepest hue to his offence .-- poor harriet ! to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery . mr . knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , \" emma , you have been no friend to harriet smith .\"-- she was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice .-- it was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered harriet \\' s imagination ; for harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed . she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments . her influence would have been enough . and now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them .-- she felt that she had been risking her friend \\' s happiness on most insufficient grounds . common sense would have directed her to tell harriet , that she must not allow herself to think of him , and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her .--\" but , with common sense ,\" she added , \" i am afraid i have had little to do .\" she was extremely angry with herself . if she could not have been angry with frank churchill too , it would have been dreadful .-- as for jane fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account . harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure .-- her days of insignificance and evil were over .-- she would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous .-- emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted . this discovery laid many smaller matters open . no doubt it had been from jealousy .-- in jane \\' s eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed . an airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack , and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison . she understood it all ; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings , she acknowledged that jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert . but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge ! there was little sympathy to be spared for any body else . emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first . considering the very superior claims of the object , it ought ; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on harriet \\' s mind , producing reserve and self - command , it would .-- she must communicate the painful truth , however , and as soon as possible . an injunction of secresy had been among mr . weston \\' s parting words . \" for the present , the whole affair was to be completely a secret . mr . churchill had made a point of it , as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost ; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum .\"-- emma had promised ; but still harriet must be excepted . it was her superior duty . in spite of her vexation , she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous , that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by harriet , which mrs . weston had just gone through by herself . the intelligence , which had been so anxiously announced to her , she was now to be anxiously announcing to another . her heart beat quick on hearing harriet \\' s footstep and voice ; so , she supposed , had poor mrs . weston felt when _she_ was approaching randalls . could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance !-- but of that , unfortunately , there could be no chance . \" well , miss woodhouse !\" cried harriet , coming eagerly into the room -- \" is not this the oddest news that ever was ?\" \" what news do you mean ?\" replied emma , unable to guess , by look or voice , whether harriet could indeed have received any hint . \" about jane fairfax . did you ever hear any thing so strange ? oh !-- you need not be afraid of owning it to me , for mr . weston has told me himself . i met him just now . he told me it was to be a great secret ; and , therefore , i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you , but he said you knew it .\" \" what did mr . weston tell you ?\"-- said emma , still perplexed . \" oh ! he told me all about it ; that jane fairfax and mr . frank churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while . how very odd !\" it was , indeed , so odd ; harriet \\' s behaviour was so extremely odd , that emma did not know how to understand it . her character appeared absolutely changed . she seemed to propose shewing no agitation , or disappointment , or peculiar concern in the discovery . emma looked at her , quite unable to speak . \" had you any idea ,\" cried harriet , \" of his being in love with her ?-- you , perhaps , might .-- you ( blushing as she spoke ) who can see into every body \\' s heart ; but nobody else --\" \" upon my word ,\" said emma , \" i begin to doubt my having any such talent . can you seriously ask me , harriet , whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i was -- tacitly , if not openly -- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings ?-- i never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of mr . frank churchill \\' s having the least regard for jane fairfax . you may be very sure that if i had , i should have cautioned you accordingly .\" \" me !\" cried harriet , colouring , and astonished . \" why should you caution me ?-- you do not think i care about mr . frank churchill .\" \" i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject ,\" replied emma , smiling ; \" but you do not mean to deny that there was a time -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ?\" \" him !-- never , never . dear miss woodhouse , how could you so mistake me ?\" turning away distressed . \" harriet !\" cried emma , after a moment \\' s pause --\" what do you mean ?-- good heaven ! what do you mean ?-- mistake you !-- am i to suppose then ?--\" she could not speak another word .-- her voice was lost ; and she sat down , waiting in great terror till harriet should answer . harriet , who was standing at some distance , and with face turned from her , did not immediately say any thing ; and when she did speak , it was in a voice nearly as agitated as emma \\' s . \" i should not have thought it possible ,\" she began , \" that you could have misunderstood me ! i know we agreed never to name him -- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else , i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person . mr . frank churchill , indeed ! i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other . i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr . frank churchill , who is like nobody by his side . and that you should have been so mistaken , is amazing !-- i am sure , but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment , i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost , to dare to think of him . at first , if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened ; that there had been matches of greater disparity ( those were your very words );-- i should not have dared to give way to -- i should not have thought it possible -- but if _you_ , who had been always acquainted with him --\" \" harriet !\" cried emma , collecting herself resolutely --\" let us understand each other now , without the possibility of farther mistake . are you speaking of -- mr . knightley ?\" \" to be sure i am . i never could have an idea of any body else -- and so i thought you knew . when we talked about him , it was as clear as possible .\" \" not quite ,\" returned emma , with forced calmness , \" for all that you then said , appeared to me to relate to a different person . i could almost assert that you had _named_ mr . frank churchill . i am sure the service mr . frank churchill had rendered you , in protecting you from the gipsies , was spoken of .\" \" oh ! miss woodhouse , how you do forget !\" \" my dear harriet , i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion . i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural :-- and you agreed to it , expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service , and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue .-- the impression of it is strong on my memory .\" \" oh , dear ,\" cried harriet , \" now i recollect what you mean ; but i was thinking of something very different at the time . it was not the gipsies -- it was not mr . frank churchill that i meant . no ! ( with some elevation ) i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance -- of mr . knightley \\' s coming and asking me to dance , when mr . elton would not stand up with me ; and when there was no other partner in the room . that was the kind action ; that was the noble benevolence and generosity ; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth .\" \" good god !\" cried emma , \" this has been a most unfortunate -- most deplorable mistake !-- what is to be done ?\" \" you would not have encouraged me , then , if you had understood me ? at least , however , i cannot be worse off than i should have been , if the other had been the person ; and now -- it _is_ possible --\" she paused a few moments . emma could not speak . \" i do not wonder , miss woodhouse ,\" she resumed , \" that you should feel a great difference between the two , as to me or as to any body . you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other . but i hope , miss woodhouse , that supposing -- that if -- strange as it may appear --. but you know they were your own words , that _more_ wonderful things had happened , matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than between mr . frank churchill and me ; and , therefore , it seems as if such a thing even as this , may have occurred before -- and if i should be so fortunate , beyond expression , as to -- if mr . knightley should really -- if _he_ does not mind the disparity , i hope , dear miss woodhouse , you will not set yourself against it , and try to put difficulties in the way . but you are too good for that , i am sure .\" harriet was standing at one of the windows . emma turned round to look at her in consternation , and hastily said , \" have you any idea of mr . knightley \\' s returning your affection ?\" \" yes ,\" replied harriet modestly , but not fearfully --\" i must say that i have .\" emma \\' s eyes were instantly withdrawn ; and she sat silently meditating , in a fixed attitude , for a few minutes . a few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart . a mind like hers , once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress . she touched -- she admitted -- she acknowledged the whole truth . why was it so much worse that harriet should be in love with mr . knightley , than with frank churchill ? why was the evil so dreadfully increased by harriet \\' s having some hope of a return ? it darted through her , with the speed of an arrow , that mr . knightley must marry no one but herself ! her own conduct , as well as her own heart , was before her in the same few minutes . she saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before . how improperly had she been acting by harriet ! how inconsiderate , how indelicate , how irrational , how unfeeling had been her conduct ! what blindness , what madness , had led her on ! it struck her with dreadful force , and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world . some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits -- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by harriet --( there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed herself loved by mr . knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now ,) gave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness .-- for her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of harriet \\' s hopes should be enquired into ; and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right .-- rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of jane fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost .-- neither of them thought but of mr . knightley and themselves . harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as miss woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight .-- emma \\' s tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than harriet \\' s , but they were not less . her voice was not unsteady ; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self , such a burst of threatening evil , such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions , must create .-- she listened with much inward suffering , but with great outward patience , to harriet \\' s detail .-- methodical , or well arranged , or very well delivered , it could not be expected to be ; but it contained , when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration , a substance to sink her spirit -- especially with the corroborating circumstances , which her own memory brought in favour of mr . knightley \\' s most improved opinion of harriet . harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances .-- emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation . from that evening , or at least from the time of miss woodhouse \\' s encouraging her to think of him , harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness !-- latterly she had been more and more aware of it . when they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully !-- he seemed to want to be acquainted with her . emma knew it to have been very much the case . she had often observed the change , to almost the same extent .-- harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him -- and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of harriet . he praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings .-- she knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet ; he had dwelt on them to her more than once .-- much that lived in harriet \\' s memory , many little particulars of the notice she had received from him , a look , a speech , a removal from one chair to another , a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by emma . circumstances that might swell to half an hour \\' s relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to harriet , were not without some degree of witness from emma herself .-- the first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at donwell , where they had been walking some time before emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed !--( harriet could not recall it without a blush .) he seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged .-- but as soon as she ( miss woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming :-- the second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at hartfield -- though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to london , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _her_ . the superior degree of confidence towards harriet , which this one article marked , gave her severe pain . on the subject of the first of the two circumstances , she did , after a little reflection , venture the following question . \" might he not ?-- is not it possible , that when enquiring , as you thought , into the state of your affections , he might be alluding to mr . martin -- he might have mr . martin \\' s interest in view ? but harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit . \" mr . martin ! no indeed !-- there was not a hint of mr . martin . i hope i know better now , than to care for mr . martin , or to be suspected of it .\" when harriet had closed her evidence , she appealed to her dear miss woodhouse , to say whether she had not good ground for hope . \" i never should have presumed to think of it at first ,\" said she , \" but for you . you told me to observe him carefully , and let his behaviour be the rule of mine -- and so i have . but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful .\" the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech , the many bitter feelings , made the utmost exertion necessary on emma \\' s side , to enable her to say on reply , \" harriet , i will only venture to declare , that mr . knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does .\" harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father \\' s footsteps . he was coming through the hall . harriet was too much agitated to encounter him . \" she could not compose herself -- mr . woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had better go ;\"-- with most ready encouragement from her friend , therefore , she passed off through another door -- and the moment she was gone , this was the spontaneous burst of emma \\' s feelings : \" oh god ! that i had never seen her !\" the rest of the day , the following night , were hardly enough for her thoughts .-- she was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours . every moment had brought a fresh surprize ; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her .-- how to understand it all ! how to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself , and living under !-- the blunders , the blindness of her own head and heart !-- she sat still , she walked about , she tried her own room , she tried the shrubbery -- in every place , every posture , she perceived that she had acted most weakly ; that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree ; that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying ; that she was wretched , and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness . to understand , thoroughly understand her own heart , was the first endeavour . to that point went every leisure moment which her father \\' s claims on her allowed , and every moment of involuntary absence of mind . how long had mr . knightley been so dear to her , as every feeling declared him now to be ? when had his influence , such influence begun ?-- when had he succeeded to that place in her affection , which frank churchill had once , for a short period , occupied ?-- she looked back ; she compared the two -- compared them , as they had always stood in her estimation , from the time of the latter \\' s becoming known to her -- and as they must at any time have been compared by her , had it -- oh ! had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison .-- she saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider mr . knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear . she saw , that in persuading herself , in fancying , in acting to the contrary , she had been entirely under a delusion , totally ignorant of her own heart -- and , in short , that she had never really cared for frank churchill at all ! this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection . this was the knowledge of herself , on the first question of inquiry , which she reached ; and without being long in reaching it .-- she was most sorrowfully indignant ; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her -- her affection for mr . knightley .-- every other part of her mind was disgusting . with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body \\' s feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body \\' s destiny . she was proved to have been universally mistaken ; and she had not quite done nothing -- for she had done mischief . she had brought evil on harriet , on herself , and she too much feared , on mr . knightley .-- were this most unequal of all connexions to take place , on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning ; for his attachment , she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of harriet \\' s ;-- and even were this not the case , he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly . mr . knightley and harriet smith !-- it was a union to distance every wonder of the kind .-- the attachment of frank churchill and jane fairfax became commonplace , threadbare , stale in the comparison , exciting no surprize , presenting no disparity , affording nothing to be said or thought .-- mr . knightley and harriet smith !-- such an elevation on her side ! such a debasement on his ! it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion , to foresee the smiles , the sneers , the merriment it would prompt at his expense ; the mortification and disdain of his brother , the thousand inconveniences to himself .-- could it be ?-- no ; it was impossible . and yet it was far , very far , from impossible .-- was it a new circumstance for a man of first - rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers ? was it new for one , perhaps too busy to seek , to be the prize of a girl who would seek him ?-- was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal , inconsistent , incongruous -- or for chance and circumstance ( as second causes ) to direct the human fate ? oh ! had she never brought harriet forward ! had she left her where she ought , and where he had told her she ought !-- had she not , with a folly which no tongue could express , prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong -- all would have been safe ; none of this dreadful sequel would have been . how harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to mr . knightley !-- how she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it !-- but harriet was less humble , had fewer scruples than formerly .-- her inferiority , whether of mind or situation , seemed little felt .-- she had seemed more sensible of mr . elton \\' s being to stoop in marrying her , than she now seemed of mr . knightley \\' s .-- alas ! was not that her own doing too ? who had been at pains to give harriet notions of self - consequence but herself ?-- who but herself had taught her , that she was to elevate herself if possible , and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment ?-- if harriet , from being humble , were grown vain , it was her doing too . chapter xii till now that she was threatened with its loss , emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with mr . knightley , first in interest and affection .-- satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been .-- long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella . she had herself been first with him for many years past . she had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared . in spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear ?-- when the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them . harriet smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly , exclusively , passionately loved by mr . knightley . _she_ could not . she could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to _her_ . she had received a very recent proof of its impartiality .-- how shocked had he been by her behaviour to miss bates ! how directly , how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject !-- not too strongly for the offence -- but far , far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear - sighted goodwill .-- she had no hope , nothing to deserve the name of hope , that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question ; but there was a hope ( at times a slight one , at times much stronger ,) that harriet might have deceived herself , and be overrating his regard for _her_ .-- wish it she must , for his sake -- be the consequence nothing to herself , but his remaining single all his life . could she be secure of that , indeed , of his never marrying at all , she believed she should be perfectly satisfied .-- let him but continue the same mr . knightley to her and her father , the same mr . knightley to all the world ; let donwell and hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence , and her peace would be fully secured .-- marriage , in fact , would not do for her . it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father , and with what she felt for him . nothing should separate her from her father . she would not marry , even if she were asked by mr . knightley . it must be her ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were .-- she should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here .-- he was expected back every day . the power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course . in the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing harriet .-- it would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther .-- she was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing harriet \\' s confidence . to talk would be only to irritate .-- she wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _one_ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday .-- harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful . this point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear emma \\' s thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- mrs . weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview . mr . weston had accompanied her to mrs . bates \\' s , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in mrs . bates \\' s parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded . a little curiosity emma had ; and she made the most of it while her friend related . mrs . weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present , to be allowed merely to write to miss fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed , and mr . churchill could be reconciled to the engagement \\' s becoming known ; as , considering every thing , she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports :-- but mr . weston had thought differently ; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for \" such things ,\" he observed , \" always got about .\" emma smiled , and felt that mr . weston had very good reason for saying so . they had gone , in short -- and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady . she had hardly been able to speak a word , and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness . the quiet , heart - felt satisfaction of the old lady , and the rapturous delight of her daughter -- who proved even too joyous to talk as usual , had been a gratifying , yet almost an affecting , scene . they were both so truly respectable in their happiness , so disinterested in every sensation ; thought so much of jane ; so much of every body , and so little of themselves , that every kindly feeling was at work for them . miss fairfax \\' s recent illness had offered a fair plea for mrs . weston to invite her to an airing ; she had drawn back and declined at first , but , on being pressed had yielded ; and , in the course of their drive , mrs . weston had , by gentle encouragement , overcome so much of her embarrassment , as to bring her to converse on the important subject . apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception , and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr . weston , must necessarily open the cause ; but when these effusions were put by , they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement . mrs . weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been , and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject . \" on the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months ,\" continued mrs . weston , \" she was energetic . this was one of her expressions . ` i will not say , that since i entered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments ; but i can say , that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour :\\'-- and the quivering lip , emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that i felt at my heart .\" \" poor girl !\" said emma . \" she thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ?\" \" wrong ! no one , i believe , can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself . ` the consequence ,\\' said she , ` has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought . but after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct . pain is no expiation . i never can be blameless . i have been acting contrary to all my sense of right ; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken , and the kindness i am now receiving , is what my conscience tells me ought not to be .\\' ` do not imagine , madam ,\\' she continued , ` that i was taught wrong . do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up . the error has been all my own ; and i do assure you that , with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give , i shall yet dread making the story known to colonel campbell .\\'\" \" poor girl !\" said emma again . \" she loves him then excessively , i suppose . it must have been from attachment only , that she could be led to form the engagement . her affection must have overpowered her judgment .\" \" yes , i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him .\" \" i am afraid ,\" returned emma , sighing , \" that i must often have contributed to make her unhappy .\" \" on your side , my love , it was very innocently done . but she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before . one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in ,\" she said , \" was that of making her _unreasonable_ . the consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been -- that had been -- hard for him to bear . ` i did not make the allowances ,\\' said she , ` which i ought to have done , for his temper and spirits -- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , i am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first .\\' she then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever i had an opportunity , to thank you -- i could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good . she was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself .\" \" if i did not know her to be happy now ,\" said emma , seriously , \" which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , i could not bear these thanks ;-- for , oh ! mrs . weston , if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss fairfax !-- well ( checking herself , and trying to be more lively ), this is all to be forgotten . you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars . they shew her to the greatest advantage . i am sure she is very good -- i hope she will be very happy . it is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for i think the merit will be all on hers .\" such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs . weston . she thought well of frank in almost every respect ; and , what was more , she loved him very much , and her defence was , therefore , earnest . she talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection -- but she had too much to urge for emma \\' s attention ; it was soon gone to brunswick square or to donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when mrs . weston ended with , \" we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but i hope it will soon come ,\" she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for . \" are you well , my emma ?\" was mrs . weston \\' s parting question . \" oh ! perfectly . i am always well , you know . be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible .\" mrs . weston \\' s communications furnished emma with more food for unpleasant reflection , by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax . she bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause . had she followed mr . knightley \\' s known wishes , in paying that attention to miss fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now .-- birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she ?-- supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into miss fairfax \\' s confidence on this important matter -- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to mr . dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of jane \\' s feelings , by the levity or carelessness of frank churchill \\' s . of all the sources of evil surrounding the former , since her coming to highbury , she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst . she must have been a perpetual enemy . they never could have been all three together , without her having stabbed jane fairfax \\' s peace in a thousand instances ; and on box hill , perhaps , it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more . the evening of this day was very long , and melancholy , at hartfield . the weather added what it could of gloom . a cold stormy rain set in , and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs , which the wind was despoiling , and the length of the day , which only made such cruel sights the longer visible . the weather affected mr . woodhouse , and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter \\' s side , and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before . it reminded her of their first forlorn tete - a - tete , on the evening of mrs . weston \\' s wedding - day ; but mr . knightley had walked in then , soon after tea , and dissipated every melancholy fancy . alas ! such delightful proofs of hartfield \\' s attraction , as those sort of visits conveyed , might shortly be over . the picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter , had proved erroneous ; no friends had deserted them , no pleasures had been lost .-- but her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction . the prospect before her now , was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled -- that might not be even partially brightened . if all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends , hartfield must be comparatively deserted ; and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness . the child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself ; and mrs . weston \\' s heart and time would be occupied by it . they should lose her ; and , probably , in great measure , her husband also .-- frank churchill would return among them no more ; and miss fairfax , it was reasonable to suppose , would soon cease to belong to highbury . they would be married , and settled either at or near enscombe . all that were good would be withdrawn ; and if to these losses , the loss of donwell were to be added , what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach ? mr . knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort !-- no longer walking in at all hours , as if ever willing to change his own home for their \\' s !-- how was it to be endured ? and if he were to be lost to them for harriet \\' s sake ; if he were to be thought of hereafter , as finding in harriet \\' s society all that he wanted ; if harriet were to be the chosen , the first , the dearest , the friend , the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence ; what could be increasing emma \\' s wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind , that it had been all her own work ? when it came to such a pitch as this , she was not able to refrain from a start , or a heavy sigh , or even from walking about the room for a few seconds -- and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn , was in the resolution of her own better conduct , and the hope that , however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past , it would yet find her more rational , more acquainted with herself , and leave her less to regret when it were gone . chapter xiii the weather continued much the same all the following morning ; and the same loneliness , and the same melancholy , seemed to reign at hartfield -- but in the afternoon it cleared ; the wind changed into a softer quarter ; the clouds were carried off ; the sun appeared ; it was summer again . with all the eagerness which such a transition gives , emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible . never had the exquisite sight , smell , sensation of nature , tranquil , warm , and brilliant after a storm , been more attractive to her . she longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on mr . perry \\' s coming in soon after dinner , with a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery .-- there , with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , she had taken a few turns , when she saw mr . knightley passing through the garden door , and coming towards her .-- it was the first intimation of his being returned from london . she had been thinking of him the moment before , as unquestionably sixteen miles distant .-- there was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind . she must be collected and calm . in half a minute they were together . the \" how d \\' ye do \\' s \" were quiet and constrained on each side . she asked after their mutual friends ; they were all well .-- when had he left them ?-- only that morning . he must have had a wet ride .-- yes .-- he meant to walk with her , she found . \" he had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors .\"-- she thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully ; and the first possible cause for it , suggested by her fears , was , that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother , and was pained by the manner in which they had been received . they walked together . he was silent . she thought he was often looking at her , and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give . and this belief produced another dread . perhaps he wanted to speak to her , of his attachment to harriet ; he might be watching for encouragement to begin .-- she did not , could not , feel equal to lead the way to any such subject . he must do it all himself . yet she could not bear this silence . with him it was most unnatural . she considered -- resolved -- and , trying to smile , began -- \" you have some news to hear , now you are come back , that will rather surprize you .\" \" have i ?\" said he quietly , and looking at her ; \" of what nature ?\" \" oh ! the best nature in the world -- a wedding .\" after waiting a moment , as if to be sure she intended to say no more , he replied , \" if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill , i have heard that already .\" \" how is it possible ?\" cried emma , turning her glowing cheeks towards him ; for , while she spoke , it occurred to her that he might have called at mrs . goddard \\' s in his way . \" i had a few lines on parish business from mr . weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened .\" emma was quite relieved , and could presently say , with a little more composure , \" _you_ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions .-- i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution .-- i wish i had attended to it -- but --( with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) i seem to have been doomed to blindness .\" for a moment or two nothing was said , and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest , till she found her arm drawn within his , and pressed against his heart , and heard him thus saying , in a tone of great sensibility , speaking low , \" time , my dearest emma , time will heal the wound .-- your own excellent sense -- your exertions for your father \\' s sake -- i know you will not allow yourself --.\" her arm was pressed again , as he added , in a more broken and subdued accent , \" the feelings of the warmest friendship -- indignation -- abominable scoundrel !\"-- and in a louder , steadier tone , he concluded with , \" he will soon be gone . they will soon be in yorkshire . i am sorry for _her_ . she deserves a better fate .\" emma understood him ; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender consideration , replied , \" you are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and i must set you right .-- i am not in want of that sort of compassion . my blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of , and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier .\" \" emma !\" cried he , looking eagerly at her , \" are you , indeed ?\"-- but checking himself --\" no , no , i understand you -- forgive me -- i am pleased that you can say even so much .-- he is no object of regret , indeed ! and it will not be very long , i hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason .-- fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled !-- i could never , i confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt -- i could only be certain that there was a preference -- and a preference which i never believed him to deserve .-- he is a disgrace to the name of man .-- and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman ?-- jane , jane , you will be a miserable creature .\" \" mr . knightley ,\" said emma , trying to be lively , but really confused -- \" i am in a very extraordinary situation . i cannot let you continue in your error ; and yet , perhaps , since my manners gave such an impression , i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of , as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse .-- but i never have .\" he listened in perfect silence . she wished him to speak , but he would not . she supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency ; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion . she went on , however . \" i have very little to say for my own conduct .-- i was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased .-- an old story , probably -- a common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as i do for understanding . many circumstances assisted the temptation . he was the son of mr . weston -- he was continually here -- i always found him very pleasant -- and , in short , for ( with a sigh ) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously , they all centre in this at last -- my vanity was flattered , and i allowed his attentions . latterly , however -- for some time , indeed -- i have had no idea of their meaning any thing .-- i thought them a habit , a trick , nothing that called for seriousness on my side . he has imposed on me , but he has not injured me . i have never been attached to him . and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour . he never wished to attach me . it was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another .-- it was his object to blind all about him ; and no one , i am sure , could be more effectually blinded than myself -- except that i was _not_ blinded -- that it was my good fortune -- that , in short , i was somehow or other safe from him .\" she had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible ; but he was silent ; and , as far as she could judge , deep in thought . at last , and tolerably in his usual tone , he said , \" i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill .-- i can suppose , however , that i may have underrated him . my acquaintance with him has been but trifling .-- and even if i have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well .-- with such a woman he has a chance .-- i have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , i shall certainly wish him well .\" \" i have no doubt of their being happy together ,\" said emma ; \" i believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached .\" \" he is a most fortunate man !\" returned mr . knightley , with energy . \" so early in life -- at three - and - twenty -- a period when , if a man chuses a wife , he generally chuses ill . at three - and - twenty to have drawn such a prize ! what years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him !-- assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love , for jane fairfax \\' s character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour ,-- equality of situation -- i mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one -- and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants .-- a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _her_ regard , must , i think , be the happiest of mortals .-- frank churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune . every thing turns out for his good .-- he meets with a young woman at a watering - place , gains her affection , cannot even weary her by negligent treatment -- and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him , they could not have found her superior .-- his aunt is in the way .-- his aunt dies .-- he has only to speak .-- his friends are eager to promote his happiness .-- he had used every body ill -- and they are all delighted to forgive him .-- he is a fortunate man indeed !\" \" you speak as if you envied him .\" \" and i do envy him , emma . in one respect he is the object of my envy .\" emma could say no more . they seemed to be within half a sentence of harriet , and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject , if possible . she made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in brunswick square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when mr . knightley startled her , by saying , \" you will not ask me what is the point of envy .-- you are determined , i see , to have no curiosity .-- you are wise -- but _i_ cannot be wise . emma , i must tell you what you will not ask , though i may wish it unsaid the next moment .\" \" oh ! then , don \\' t speak it , don \\' t speak it ,\" she eagerly cried . \" take a little time , consider , do not commit yourself .\" \" thank you ,\" said he , in an accent of deep mortification , and not another syllable followed . emma could not bear to give him pain . he was wishing to confide in her -- perhaps to consult her ;-- cost her what it would , she would listen . she might assist his resolution , or reconcile him to it ; she might give just praise to harriet , or , by representing to him his own independence , relieve him from that state of indecision , which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his .-- they had reached the house . \" you are going in , i suppose ?\" said he . \" no ,\"-- replied emma -- quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke --\" i should like to take another turn . mr . perry is not gone .\" and , after proceeding a few steps , she added -- \" i stopped you ungraciously , just now , mr . knightley , and , i am afraid , gave you pain .-- but if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- as a friend , indeed , you may command me .-- i will hear whatever you like . i will tell you exactly what i think .\" \" as a friend !\"-- repeated mr . knightley .--\" emma , that i fear is a word -- no , i have no wish -- stay , yes , why should i hesitate ?-- i have gone too far already for concealment .-- emma , i accept your offer -- extraordinary as it may seem , i accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend .-- tell me , then , have i no chance of ever succeeding ?\" he stopped in his earnestness to look the question , and the expression of his eyes overpowered her . \" my dearest emma ,\" said he , \" for dearest you will always be , whatever the event of this hour \\' s conversation , my dearest , most beloved emma -- tell me at once . say ` no ,\\' if it is to be said .\"-- she could really say nothing .--\" you are silent ,\" he cried , with great animation ; \" absolutely silent ! at present i ask no more .\" emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment . the dread of being awakened from the happiest dream , was perhaps the most prominent feeling . \" i cannot make speeches , emma :\" he soon resumed ; and in a tone of such sincere , decided , intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing .--\" if i loved you less , i might be able to talk about it more . but you know what i am .-- you hear nothing but truth from me .-- i have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it .-- bear with the truths i would tell you now , dearest emma , as well as you have borne with them . the manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them . god knows , i have been a very indifferent lover .-- but you understand me .-- yes , you see , you understand my feelings -- and will return them if you can . at present , i ask only to hear , once to hear your voice .\" while he spoke , emma \\' s mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word -- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that harriet \\' s hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself .-- and not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that harriet \\' s secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not .-- it was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two -- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , emma had it not . she felt for harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain . she had led her friend astray , and it would be a reproach to her for ever ; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings , and as strong as it had ever been before , in reprobating any such alliance for him , as most unequal and degrading . her way was clear , though not quite smooth .-- she spoke then , on being so entreated .-- what did she say ?-- just what she ought , of course . a lady always does .-- she said enough to shew there need not be despair -- and to invite him to say more himself . he _had_ despaired at one period ; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence , as for the time crushed every hope ;-- she had begun by refusing to hear him .-- the change had perhaps been somewhat sudden ;-- her proposal of taking another turn , her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to , might be a little extraordinary !-- she felt its inconsistency ; but mr . knightley was so obliging as to put up with it , and seek no farther explanation . seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material .-- mr . knightley could not impute to emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his . he had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence . he had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it . he had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore frank churchill \\' s engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her .-- the rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings . the delightful assurance of her total indifference towards frank churchill , of her having a heart completely disengaged from him , had given birth to the hope , that , in time , he might gain her affection himself ;-- but it had been no present hope -- he had only , in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment , aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her .-- the superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting .-- the affection , which he had been asking to be allowed to create , if he could , was already his !-- within half an hour , he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind , to something so like perfect happiness , that it could bear no other name . _her_ change was equal .-- this one half - hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved , had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance , jealousy , or distrust .-- on his side , there had been a long - standing jealousy , old as the arrival , or even the expectation , of frank churchill .-- he had been in love with emma , and jealous of frank churchill , from about the same period , one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other . it was his jealousy of frank churchill that had taken him from the country .-- the box hill party had decided him on going away . he would save himself from witnessing again such permitted , encouraged attentions .-- he had gone to learn to be indifferent .-- but he had gone to a wrong place . there was too much domestic happiness in his brother \\' s house ; woman wore too amiable a form in it ; isabella was too much like emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities , which always brought the other in brilliancy before him , for much to have been done , even had his time been longer .-- he had stayed on , however , vigorously , day after day -- till this very morning \\' s post had conveyed the history of jane fairfax .-- then , with the gladness which must be felt , nay , which he did not scruple to feel , having never believed frank churchill to be at all deserving emma , was there so much fond solicitude , so much keen anxiety for her , that he could stay no longer . he had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery . he had found her agitated and low .-- frank churchill was a villain .-- he heard her declare that she had never loved him . frank churchill \\' s character was not desperate .-- she was his own emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of frank churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow . chapter xiv what totally different feelings did emma take back into the house from what she had brought out !-- she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering ;-- she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness , and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away . they sat down to tea -- the same party round the same table -- how often it had been collected !-- and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn , and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun !-- but never in such a state of spirits , never in any thing like it ; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house , or even the attentive daughter . poor mr . woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming , and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride .-- could he have seen the heart , he would have cared very little for the lungs ; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil , without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either , he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from mr . perry , and talked on with much self - contentment , totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return . as long as mr . knightley remained with them , emma \\' s fever continued ; but when he was gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night , which was the tax for such an evening , she found one or two such very serious points to consider , as made her feel , that even her happiness must have some alloy . her father -- and harriet . she could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims ; and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost , was the question . with respect to her father , it was a question soon answered . she hardly knew yet what mr . knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father .-- she even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought . while he lived , it must be only an engagement ; but she flattered herself , that if divested of the danger of drawing her away , it might become an increase of comfort to him .-- how to do her best by harriet , was of more difficult decision ;-- how to spare her from any unnecessary pain ; how to make her any possible atonement ; how to appear least her enemy ?-- on these subjects , her perplexity and distress were very great -- and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it .-- she could only resolve at last , that she would still avoid a meeting with her , and communicate all that need be told by letter ; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from highbury , and -- indulging in one scheme more -- nearly resolve , that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to brunswick square .-- isabella had been pleased with harriet ; and a few weeks spent in london must give her some amusement .-- she did not think it in harriet \\' s nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety , by the streets , the shops , and the children .-- at any rate , it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself , from whom every thing was due ; a separation for the present ; an averting of the evil day , when they must all be together again . she rose early , and wrote her letter to harriet ; an employment which left her so very serious , so nearly sad , that mr . knightley , in walking up to hartfield to breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before . he had not left her long , by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else , when a letter was brought her from randalls -- a very thick letter ;-- she guessed what it must contain , and deprecated the necessity of reading it .-- she was now in perfect charity with frank churchill ; she wanted no explanations , she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself -- and as for understanding any thing he wrote , she was sure she was incapable of it .-- it must be waded through , however . she opened the packet ; it was too surely so ;-- a note from mrs . weston to herself , ushered in the letter from frank to mrs . weston . \" i have the greatest pleasure , my dear emma , in forwarding to you the enclosed . i know what thorough justice you will do it , and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect .-- i think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again ; but i will not delay you by a long preface .-- we are quite well .-- this letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness i have been feeling lately .-- i did not quite like your looks on tuesday , but it was an ungenial morning ; and though you will never own being affected by weather , i think every body feels a north - east wind .-- i felt for your dear father very much in the storm of tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning , but had the comfort of hearing last night , by mr . perry , that it had not made him ill . \" yours ever , \" a . w .\" [ to mrs . weston .] windsor - july . my dear madam , \" if i made myself intelligible yesterday , this letter will be expected ; but expected or not , i know it will be read with candour and indulgence .-- you are all goodness , and i believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct .-- but i have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent . my courage rises while i write . it is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble . i have already met with such success in two applications for pardon , that i may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours , and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence .-- you must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when i first arrived at randalls ; you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards . this was the fact . my right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment , is another question . i shall not discuss it here . for my temptation to _think_ it a right , i refer every caviller to a brick house , sashed windows below , and casements above , in highbury . i dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and i was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement .-- had she refused , i should have gone mad .-- but you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this ?-- what did you look forward to ?-- to any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness . every possibility of good was before me , and the first of blessings secured , in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence . if you need farther explanation , i have the honour , my dear madam , of being your husband \\' s son , and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good , which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of .-- see me , then , under these circumstances , arriving on my first visit to randalls ;-- and here i am conscious of wrong , for that visit might have been sooner paid . you will look back and see that i did not come till miss fairfax was in highbury ; and as _you_ were the person slighted , you will forgive me instantly ; but i must work on my father \\' s compassion , by reminding him , that so long as i absented myself from his house , so long i lost the blessing of knowing you . my behaviour , during the very happy fortnight which i spent with you , did not , i hope , lay me open to reprehension , excepting on one point . and now i come to the principal , the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you , which excites my own anxiety , or requires very solicitous explanation . with the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do i mention miss woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think i ought to add , with the deepest humiliation .-- a few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure i acknowledge myself liable to .-- my behaviour to miss woodhouse indicated , i believe , more than it ought .-- in order to assist a concealment so essential to me , i was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown .-- i cannot deny that miss woodhouse was my ostensible object -- but i am sure you will believe the declaration , that had i not been convinced of her indifference , i would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on .-- amiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish .-- she received my attentions with an easy , friendly , goodhumoured playfulness , which exactly suited me . we seemed to understand each other . from our relative situation , those attentions were her due , and were felt to be so .-- whether miss woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight , i cannot say ;-- when i called to take leave of her , i remember that i was within a moment of confessing the truth , and i then fancied she was not without suspicion ; but i have no doubt of her having since detected me , at least in some degree .-- she may not have surmised the whole , but her quickness must have penetrated a part . i cannot doubt it . you will find , whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints , that it did not take her wholly by surprize . she frequently gave me hints of it . i remember her telling me at the ball , that i owed mrs . elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfax .-- i hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss . while you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhouse , i could deserve nothing from either . acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said emma woodhouse , whom i regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself .-- whatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to . my heart was in highbury , and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be , and with the least suspicion . if you remember any queernesses , set them all to the right account .-- of the pianoforte so much talked of , i feel it only necessary to say , that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f --, who would never have allowed me to send it , had any choice been given her .-- the delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement , my dear madam , is much beyond my power of doing justice to . you will soon , i earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself .-- no description can describe her . she must tell you herself what she is -- yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit .-- since i began this letter , which will be longer than i foresaw , i have heard from her .-- she gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , i dare not depend . i want to have your opinion of her looks . i know you will soon call on her ; she is living in dread of the visit . perhaps it is paid already . let me hear from you without delay ; i am impatient for a thousand particulars . remember how few minutes i was at randalls , and in how bewildered , how mad a state : and i am not much better yet ; still insane either from happiness or misery . when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with , of her excellence and patience , and my uncle \\' s generosity , i am mad with joy : but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her , and how little i deserve to be forgiven , i am mad with anger . if i could but see her again !-- but i must not propose it yet . my uncle has been too good for me to encroach .-- i must still add to this long letter . you have not heard all that you ought to hear . i could not give any connected detail yesterday ; but the suddenness , and , in one light , the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out , needs explanation ; for though the event of the 26th ult ., as you will conclude , immediately opened to me the happiest prospects , i should not have presumed on such early measures , but from the very particular circumstances , which left me not an hour to lose . i should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty , and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement .-- but i had no choice . the hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman -- here , my dear madam , i was obliged to leave off abruptly , to recollect and compose myself .-- i have been walking over the country , and am now , i hope , rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be .-- it is , in fact , a most mortifying retrospect for me . i behaved shamefully . and here i can admit , that my manners to miss w ., in being unpleasant to miss f ., were highly blameable . _she_ disapproved them , which ought to have been enough .-- my plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient .-- she was displeased ; i thought unreasonably so : i thought her , on a thousand occasions , unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious : i thought her even cold . but she was always right . if i had followed her judgment , and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper , i should have escaped the greatest unhappiness i have ever known .-- we quarrelled .-- do you remember the morning spent at donwell ?-- _there_ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis . i was late ; i met her walking home by herself , and wanted to walk with her , but she would not suffer it . she absolutely refused to allow me , which i then thought most unreasonable . now , however , i see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion . while i , to blind the world to our engagement , was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman , was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless ?-- had we been met walking together between donwell and highbury , the truth must have been suspected .-- i was mad enough , however , to resent .-- i doubted her affection . i doubted it more the next day on box hill ; when , provoked by such conduct on my side , such shameful , insolent neglect of her , and such apparent devotion to miss w ., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure , she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me .-- in short , my dear madam , it was a quarrel blameless on her side , abominable on mine ; and i returned the same evening to richmond , though i might have staid with you till the next morning , merely because i would be as angry with her as possible . even then , i was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time ; but i was the injured person , injured by her coldness , and i went away determined that she should make the first advances .-- i shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party . had you witnessed my behaviour there , i can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again . its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced : as soon as she found i was really gone from randalls , she closed with the offer of that officious mrs . elton ; the whole system of whose treatment of her , by the bye , has ever filled me with indignation and hatred . i must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , i should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known .-- ` jane ,\\' indeed !-- you will observe that i have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you . think , then , what i must have endured in hearing it bandied between the eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition , and all the insolence of imaginary superiority . have patience with me , i shall soon have done .-- she closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again .-- _she_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_ : _she_ _dissolved_ _it_ .-- this letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt \\' s death . i answered it within an hour ; but from the confusion of my mind , and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once , my answer , instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day , was locked up in my writing - desk ; and i , trusting that i had written enough , though but a few lines , to satisfy her , remained without any uneasiness .-- i was rather disappointed that i did not hear from her again speedily ; but i made excuses for her , and was too busy , and -- may i add ?-- too cheerful in my views to be captious .-- we removed to windsor ; and two days afterwards i received a parcel from her , my own letters all returned !-- and a few lines at the same time by the post , stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last ; and adding , that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued , and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible , she now sent me , by a safe conveyance , all my letters , and requested , that if i could not directly command hers , so as to send them to highbury within a week , i would forward them after that period to her at --: in short , the full direction to mr . smallridge \\' s , near bristol , stared me in the face . i knew the name , the place , i knew all about it , and instantly saw what she had been doing . it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which i knew her to possess ; and the secrecy she had maintained , as to any such design in her former letter , was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy . for the world would not she have seemed to threaten me .-- imagine the shock ; imagine how , till i had actually detected my own blunder , i raved at the blunders of the post .-- what was to be done ?-- one thing only .-- i must speak to my uncle . without his sanction i could not hope to be listened to again .-- i spoke ; circumstances were in my favour ; the late event had softened away his pride , and he was , earlier than i could have anticipated , wholly reconciled and complying ; and could say at last , poor man ! with a deep sigh , that he wished i might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done .-- i felt that it would be of a different sort .-- are you disposed to pity me for what i must have suffered in opening the cause to him , for my suspense while all was at stake ?-- no ; do not pity me till i reached highbury , and saw how ill i had made her . do not pity me till i saw her wan , sick looks .-- i reached highbury at the time of day when , from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour , i was certain of a good chance of finding her alone .-- i was not disappointed ; and at last i was not disappointed either in the object of my journey . a great deal of very reasonable , very just displeasure i had to persuade away . but it is done ; we are reconciled , dearer , much dearer , than ever , and no moment \\' s uneasiness can ever occur between us again . now , my dear madam , i will release you ; but i could not conclude before . a thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me , and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her .-- if you think me in a way to be happier than i deserve , i am quite of your opinion .-- miss w . calls me the child of good fortune . i hope she is right .-- in one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , your obliged and affectionate son , f . c . weston churchill . chapter xv this letter must make its way to emma \\' s feelings . she was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that mrs . weston foretold . as soon as she came to her own name , it was irresistible ; every line relating to herself was interesting , and almost every line agreeable ; and when this charm ceased , the subject could still maintain itself , by the natural return of her former regard for the writer , and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment . she never stopt till she had gone through the whole ; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong , yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered , and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to mrs . weston , and so much in love with miss fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever . she thought so well of the letter , that when mr . knightley came again , she desired him to read it . she was sure of mrs . weston \\' s wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like mr . knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct . \" i shall be very glad to look it over ,\" said he ; \" but it seems long . i will take it home with me at night .\" but that would not do . mr . weston was to call in the evening , and she must return it by him . \" i would rather be talking to you ,\" he replied ; \" but as it seems a matter of justice , it shall be done .\" he began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , \" had i been offered the sight of one of this gentleman \\' s letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference .\" he proceeded a little farther , reading to himself ; and then , with a smile , observed , \" humph ! a fine complimentary opening : but it is his way . one man \\' s style must not be the rule of another \\' s . we will not be severe .\" \" it will be natural for me ,\" he added shortly afterwards , \" to speak my opinion aloud as i read . by doing it , i shall feel that i am near you . it will not be so great a loss of time : but if you dislike it --\" \" not at all . i should wish it .\" mr . knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity . \" he trifles here ,\" said he , \" as to the temptation . he knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge .-- bad .-- he ought not to have formed the engagement .--` his father \\' s disposition :\\'-- he is unjust , however , to his father . mr . weston \\' s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions ; but mr . weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it .-- very true ; he did not come till miss fairfax was here .\" \" and i have not forgotten ,\" said emma , \" how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would . you pass it over very handsomely -- but you were perfectly right .\" \" i was not quite impartial in my judgment , emma :-- but yet , i think -- had _you_ not been in the case -- i should still have distrusted him .\" when he came to miss woodhouse , he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud -- all that related to her , with a smile ; a look ; a shake of the head ; a word or two of assent , or disapprobation ; or merely of love , as the subject required ; concluding , however , seriously , and , after steady reflection , thus -- \" very bad -- though it might have been worse .-- playing a most dangerous game . too much indebted to the event for his acquittal .-- no judge of his own manners by you .-- always deceived in fact by his own wishes , and regardless of little besides his own convenience .-- fancying you to have fathomed his secret . natural enough !-- his own mind full of intrigue , that he should suspect it in others .-- mystery ; finesse -- how they pervert the understanding ! my emma , does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other ?\" emma agreed to it , and with a blush of sensibility on harriet \\' s account , which she could not give any sincere explanation of . \" you had better go on ,\" said she . he did so , but very soon stopt again to say , \" the pianoforte ! ah ! that was the act of a very , very young man , one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure . a boyish scheme , indeed !-- i cannot comprehend a man \\' s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with ; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument \\' s coming if she could .\" after this , he made some progress without any pause . frank churchill \\' s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing . \" i perfectly agree with you , sir ,\"-- was then his remark . \" you did behave very shamefully . you never wrote a truer line .\" and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to jane fairfax \\' s sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , \" this is very bad .-- he had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily .-- she must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could . he should have respected even unreasonable scruples , had there been such ; but hers were all reasonable . we must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment .\" emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party , and grew uncomfortable . her own behaviour had been so very improper ! she was deeply ashamed , and a little afraid of his next look . it was all read , however , steadily , attentively , and without the smallest remark ; and , excepting one momentary glance at her , instantly withdrawn , in the fear of giving pain -- no remembrance of box hill seemed to exist . \" there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends , the eltons ,\" was his next observation .--\" his feelings are natural .-- what ! actually resolve to break with him entirely !-- she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each -- she dissolved it .-- what a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour !-- well , he must be a most extraordinary --\" \" nay , nay , read on .-- you will find how very much he suffers .\" \" i hope he does ,\" replied mr . knightley coolly , and resuming the letter . \"` smallridge !\\'-- what does this mean ? what is all this ?\" \" she had engaged to go as governess to mrs . smallridge \\' s children -- a dear friend of mrs . elton \\' s -- a neighbour of maple grove ; and , by the bye , i wonder how mrs . elton bears the disappointment ?\" \" say nothing , my dear emma , while you oblige me to read -- not even of mrs . elton . only one page more . i shall soon have done . what a letter the man writes !\" \" i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him .\" \" well , there _is_ feeling here .-- he does seem to have suffered in finding her ill .-- certainly , i can have no doubt of his being fond of her . ` dearer , much dearer than ever .\\' i hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation .-- he is a very liberal thanker , with his thousands and tens of thousands .--` happier than i deserve .\\' come , he knows himself there . ` miss woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune .\\'-- those were miss woodhouse \\' s words , were they ?-- and a fine ending -- and there is the letter . the child of good fortune ! that was your name for him , was it ?\" \" you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am ; but still you must , at least i hope you must , think the better of him for it . i hope it does him some service with you .\" \" yes , certainly it does . he has had great faults , faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness ; and i am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves : but still as he is , beyond a doubt , really attached to miss fairfax , and will soon , it may be hoped , have the advantage of being constantly with her , i am very ready to believe his character will improve , and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants . and now , let me talk to you of something else . i have another person \\' s interest at present so much at heart , that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill . ever since i left you this morning , emma , my mind has been hard at work on one subject .\" the subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike english , such as mr . knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father . emma \\' s answer was ready at the first word . \" while her dear father lived , any change of condition must be impossible for her . she could never quit him .\" part only of this answer , however , was admitted . the impossibility of her quitting her father , mr . knightley felt as strongly as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change , he could not agree to . he had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce mr . woodhouse to remove with her to donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of mr . woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father \\' s comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded . mr . woodhouse taken from hartfield !-- no , he felt that it ought not to be attempted . but the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at hartfield ; that so long as her father \\' s happiness in other words his life -- required hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise . of their all removing to donwell , emma had already had her own passing thoughts . like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her . she was sensible of all the affection it evinced . she felt that , in quitting donwell , he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits ; that in living constantly with her father , and in no house of his own , there would be much , very much , to be borne with . she promised to think of it , and advised him to think of it more ; but he was fully convinced , that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject . he had given it , he could assure her , very long and calm consideration ; he had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning , to have his thoughts to himself . \" ah ! there is one difficulty unprovided for ,\" cried emma . \" i am sure william larkins will not like it . you must get his consent before you ask mine .\" she promised , however , to think of it ; and pretty nearly promised , moreover , to think of it , with the intention of finding it a very good scheme . it is remarkable , that emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry , whose rights as heir - expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded . think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of mr . knightley \\' s marrying jane fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt . this proposal of his , this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfield -- the more she contemplated it , the more pleasing it became . his evils seemed to lessen , her own advantages to increase , their mutual good to outweigh every drawback . such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her !-- such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy ! she would have been too happy but for poor harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from hartfield . the delightful family party which emma was securing for herself , poor harriet must , in mere charitable caution , be kept at a distance from . she would be a loser in every way . emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment . in such a party , harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise ; but for the poor girl herself , it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment . in time , of course , mr . knightley would be forgotten , that is , supplanted ; but this could not be expected to happen very early . mr . knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure ;-- not like mr . elton . mr . knightley , always so kind , so feeling , so truly considerate for every body , would never deserve to be less worshipped than now ; and it really was too much to hope even of harriet , that she could be in love with more than _three_ men in one year . chapter xvi it was a very great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting . their intercourse was painful enough by letter . how much worse , had they been obliged to meet ! harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate .-- it might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke . she had no difficulty in procuring isabella \\' s invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention .-- there was a tooth amiss . harriet really wished , and had wished some time , to consult a dentist . mrs . john knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a mr . wingfield , she was quite eager to have harriet under her care .-- when it was thus settled on her sister \\' s side , emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable .-- harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in mr . woodhouse \\' s carriage .-- it was all arranged , it was all completed , and harriet was safe in brunswick square . now emma could , indeed , enjoy mr . knightley \\' s visits ; now she could talk , and she could listen with true happiness , unchecked by that sense of injustice , of guilt , of something most painful , which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her , how much might at that moment , and at a little distance , be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself . the difference of harriet at mrs . goddard \\' s , or in london , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in emma \\' s sensations ; but she could not think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself . she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which harriet had occupied . there was a communication before her , one which _she_ only could be competent to make -- the confession of her engagement to her father ; but she would have nothing to do with it at present .-- she had resolved to defer the disclosure till mrs . weston were safe and well . no additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved -- and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time .-- a fortnight , at least , of leisure and peace of mind , to crown every warmer , but more agitating , delight , should be hers . she soon resolved , equally as a duty and a pleasure , to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax .-- she ought to go -- and she was longing to see her ; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill . it would be a _secret_ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing jane might communicate . she went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after box hill , when poor jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected .-- the fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name .-- she heard patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor miss bates had before made so happily intelligible .-- no ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , \" beg her to walk up ;\"-- and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient .-- emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging . there was consciousness , animation , and warmth ; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted .-- she came forward with an offered hand ; and said , in a low , but very feeling tone , \" this is most kind , indeed !-- miss woodhouse , it is impossible for me to express -- i hope you will believe -- excuse me for being so entirely without words .\" emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of mrs . elton \\' s voice from the sitting - room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand . mrs . bates and mrs . elton were together . miss bates was out , which accounted for the previous tranquillity . emma could have wished mrs . elton elsewhere ; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body ; and as mrs . elton met her with unusual graciousness , she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm . she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs . elton \\' s thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits ; it was being in miss fairfax \\' s confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people . emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to mrs . bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady \\' s replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods , \" we can finish this some other time , you know . you and i shall not want opportunities . and , in fact , you have heard all the essential already . i only wanted to prove to you that mrs . s . admits our apology , and is not offended . you see how delightfully she writes . oh ! she is a sweet creature ! you would have doated on her , had you gone .-- but not a word more . let us be discreet -- quite on our good behaviour .-- hush !-- you remember those lines -- i forget the poem at this moment : \" for when a lady \\' s in the case , \" you know all other things give place .\" now i say , my dear , in _our_ case , for _lady_ , read ---- mum ! a word to the wise .-- i am in a fine flow of spirits , an \\' t i ? but i want to set your heart at ease as to mrs . s .-- _my_ representation , you see , has quite appeased her .\" and again , on emma \\' s merely turning her head to look at mrs . bates \\' s knitting , she added , in a half whisper , \" i mentioned no _names_ , you will observe .-- oh ! no ; cautious as a minister of state . i managed it extremely well .\" emma could not doubt . it was a palpable display , repeated on every possible occasion . when they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and mrs . weston , she found herself abruptly addressed with , \" do not you think , miss woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered ?-- do not you think her cure does perry the highest credit ?--( here was a side - glance of great meaning at jane .) upon my word , perry has restored her in a wonderful short time !-- oh ! if you had seen her , as i did , when she was at the worst !\"-- and when mrs . bates was saying something to emma , whispered farther , \" we do not say a word of any _assistance_ that perry might have ; not a word of a certain young physician from windsor .-- oh ! no ; perry shall have all the credit .\" \" i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you , miss woodhouse ,\" she shortly afterwards began , \" since the party to box hill . very pleasant party . but yet i think there was something wanting . things did not seem -- that is , there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some .-- so it appeared to me at least , but i might be mistaken . however , i think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again . what say you both to our collecting the same party , and exploring to box hill again , while the fine weather lasts ?-- it must be the same party , you know , quite the same party , not _one_ exception .\" soon after this miss bates came in , and emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself , resulting , she supposed , from doubt of what might be said , and impatience to say every thing . \" thank you , dear miss woodhouse , you are all kindness .-- it is impossible to say -- yes , indeed , i quite understand -- dearest jane \\' s prospects -- that is , i do not mean .-- but she is charmingly recovered .-- how is mr . woodhouse ?-- i am so glad .-- quite out of my power .-- such a happy little circle as you find us here .-- yes , indeed .-- charming young man !-- that is -- so very friendly ; i mean good mr . perry !-- such attention to jane !\"-- and from her great , her more than commonly thankful delight towards mrs . elton for being there , emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards jane , from the vicarage quarter , which was now graciously overcome .-- after a few whispers , indeed , which placed it beyond a guess , mrs . elton , speaking louder , said , \" yes , here i am , my good friend ; and here i have been so long , that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise ; but , the truth is , that i am waiting for my lord and master . he promised to join me here , and pay his respects to you .\" \" what ! are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr . elton ?-- that will be a favour indeed ! for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and mr . elton \\' s time is so engaged .\" \" upon my word it is , miss bates .-- he really is engaged from morning to night .-- there is no end of people \\' s coming to him , on some pretence or other .-- the magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion . they seem not able to do any thing without him .--` upon my word , mr . e .,\\' i often say , ` rather you than i .-- i do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument , if i had half so many applicants .\\'-- bad enough as it is , for i absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree .-- i believe i have not played a bar this fortnight .-- however , he is coming , i assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all .\" and putting up her hand to screen her words from emma --\" a congratulatory visit , you know .-- oh ! yes , quite indispensable .\" miss bates looked about her , so happily !-- \" he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from knightley ; but he and knightley are shut up together in deep consultation .-- mr . e . is knightley \\' s right hand .\" emma would not have smiled for the world , and only said , \" is mr . elton gone on foot to donwell ?-- he will have a hot walk .\" \" oh ! no , it is a meeting at the crown , a regular meeting . weston and cole will be there too ; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead .-- i fancy mr . e . and knightley have every thing their own way .\" \" have not you mistaken the day ?\" said emma . \" i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till to - morrow .-- mr . knightley was at hartfield yesterday , and spoke of it as for saturday .\" \" oh ! no , the meeting is certainly to - day ,\" was the abrupt answer , which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mrs . elton \\' s side .-- \" i do believe ,\" she continued , \" this is the most troublesome parish that ever was . we never heard of such things at maple grove .\" \" your parish there was small ,\" said jane . \" upon my word , my dear , i do not know , for i never heard the subject talked of .\" \" but it is proved by the smallness of the school , which i have heard you speak of , as under the patronage of your sister and mrs . bragge ; the only school , and not more than five - and - twenty children .\" \" ah ! you clever creature , that \\' s very true . what a thinking brain you have ! i say , jane , what a perfect character you and i should make , if we could be shaken together . my liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection .-- not that i presume to insinuate , however , that _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already .-- but hush !-- not a word , if you please .\" it seemed an unnecessary caution ; jane was wanting to give her words , not to mrs . elton , but to miss woodhouse , as the latter plainly saw . the wish of distinguishing her , as far as civility permitted , was very evident , though it could not often proceed beyond a look . mr . elton made his appearance . his lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity . \" very pretty , sir , upon my word ; to send me on here , to be an encumbrance to my friends , so long before you vouchsafe to come !-- but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with . you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared .-- here have i been sitting this hour , giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience -- for who can say , you know , how soon it may be wanted ?\" mr . elton was so hot and tired , that all this wit seemed thrown away . his civilities to the other ladies must be paid ; but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering , and the walk he had had for nothing . \" when i got to donwell ,\" said he , \" knightley could not be found . very odd ! very unaccountable ! after the note i sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one .\" \" donwell !\" cried his wife .--\" my dear mr . e ., you have not been to donwell !-- you mean the crown ; you come from the meeting at the crown .\" \" no , no , that \\' s to - morrow ; and i particularly wanted to see knightley to - day on that very account .-- such a dreadful broiling morning !-- i went over the fields too --( speaking in a tone of great ill - usage ,) which made it so much the worse . and then not to find him at home ! i assure you i am not at all pleased . and no apology left , no message for me . the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected .-- very extraordinary !-- and nobody knew at all which way he was gone . perhaps to hartfield , perhaps to the abbey mill , perhaps into his woods .-- miss woodhouse , this is not like our friend knightley !-- can you explain it ?\" emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary , indeed , and that she had not a syllable to say for him . \" i cannot imagine ,\" said mrs . elton , ( feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do ,) \" i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you , of all people in the world ! the very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten !-- my dear mr . e ., he must have left a message for you , i am sure he must .-- not even knightley could be so very eccentric ;-- and his servants forgot it . depend upon it , that was the case : and very likely to happen with the donwell servants , who are all , i have often observed , extremely awkward and remiss .-- i am sure i would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration . and as for mrs . hodges , wright holds her very cheap indeed .-- she promised wright a receipt , and never sent it .\" \" i met william larkins ,\" continued mr . elton , \" as i got near the house , and he told me i should not find his master at home , but i did not believe him .-- william seemed rather out of humour . he did not know what was come to his master lately , he said , but he could hardly ever get the speech of him . i have nothing to do with william \\' s wants , but it really is of very great importance that _i_ should see knightley to - day ; and it becomes a matter , therefore , of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk to no purpose .\" emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly . in all probability she was at this very time waited for there ; and mr . knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards mr . elton , if not towards william larkins . she was pleased , on taking leave , to find miss fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say , \" it is as well , perhaps , that i have not had the possibility . had you not been surrounded by other friends , i might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct .-- i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent .\" \" oh !\" cried jane , with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure --\" there would have been no danger . the danger would have been of my wearying you . you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest --. indeed , miss woodhouse , ( speaking more collectedly ,) with the consciousness which i have of misconduct , very great misconduct , it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends , whose good opinion is most worth preserving , are not disgusted to such a degree as to -- i have not time for half that i could wish to say . i long to make apologies , excuses , to urge something for myself . i feel it so very due . but , unfortunately -- in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend --\" \" oh ! you are too scrupulous , indeed you are ,\" cried emma warmly , and taking her hand . \" you owe me no apologies ; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them , is so perfectly satisfied , so delighted even --\" \" you are very kind , but i know what my manners were to you .-- so cold and artificial !-- i had always a part to act .-- it was a life of deceit !-- i know that i must have disgusted you .\" \" pray say no more . i feel that all the apologies should be on my side . let us forgive each other at once . we must do whatever is to be done quickest , and i think our feelings will lose no time there . i hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor ?\" \" very .\" \" and the next news , i suppose , will be , that we are to lose you -- just as i begin to know you .\" \" oh ! as to all that , of course nothing can be thought of yet . i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs . campbell .\" \" nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps ,\" replied emma , smiling --\" but , excuse me , it must be thought of .\" the smile was returned as jane answered , \" you are very right ; it has been thought of . and i will own to you , ( i am sure it will be safe ), that so far as our living with mr . churchill at enscombe , it is settled . there must be three months , at least , of deep mourning ; but when they are over , i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for .\" \" thank you , thank you .-- this is just what i wanted to be assured of .-- oh ! if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open !-- good - bye , good - bye .\" chapter xvii mrs . weston \\' s friends were all made happy by her safety ; and if the satisfaction of her well - doing could be increased to emma , it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl . she had been decided in wishing for a miss weston . she would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her , hereafter , with either of isabella \\' s sons ; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best . it would be a great comfort to mr . weston , as he grew older -- and even mr . weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense , the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home ; and mrs . weston -- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her ; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach , should not have their powers in exercise again . \" she has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me ,\" she continued --\" like la baronne d \\' almane on la comtesse d \\' ostalis , in madame de genlis \\' adelaide and theodore , and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan .\" \" that is ,\" replied mr . knightley , \" she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all . it will be the only difference .\" \" poor child !\" cried emma ; \" at that rate , what will become of her ?\" \" nothing very bad .-- the fate of thousands . she will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older . i am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest emma . i , who am owing all my happiness to _you_ , would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them ?\" emma laughed , and replied : \" but i had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people . i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it .\" \" do you ?-- i have no doubt . nature gave you understanding :-- miss taylor gave you principles . you must have done well . my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good . it was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me ?-- and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner . i do not believe i did you any good . the good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me . i could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least .\" \" i am sure you were of use to me ,\" cried emma . \" i was very often influenced rightly by you -- oftener than i would own at the time . i am very sure you did me good . and if poor little anna weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen .\" \" how often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks --` mr . knightley , i am going to do so - and - so ; papa says i may , or i have miss taylor \\' s leave \\'-- something which , you knew , i did not approve . in such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one .\" \" what an amiable creature i was !-- no wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance .\" \"` mr . knightley .\\'-- you always called me , ` mr . knightley ;\\' and , from habit , it has not so very formal a sound .-- and yet it is formal . i want you to call me something else , but i do not know what .\" \" i remember once calling you ` george ,\\' in one of my amiable fits , about ten years ago . i did it because i thought it would offend you ; but , as you made no objection , i never did it again .\" \" and cannot you call me ` george \\' now ?\" \" impossible !-- i never can call you any thing but ` mr . knightley .\\' i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs . elton , by calling you mr . k .-- but i will promise ,\" she added presently , laughing and blushing --\" i will promise to call you once by your christian name . i do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where ;-- in the building in which n . takes m . for better , for worse .\" emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her , to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies -- her wilful intimacy with harriet smith ; but it was too tender a subject .-- she could not enter on it .-- harriet was very seldom mentioned between them . this , on his side , might merely proceed from her not being thought of ; but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy , and a suspicion , from some appearances , that their friendship were declining . she was aware herself , that , parting under any other circumstances , they certainly should have corresponded more , and that her intelligence would not have rested , as it now almost wholly did , on isabella \\' s letters . he might observe that it was so . the pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him , was very little inferior to the pain of having made harriet unhappy . isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find harriet different from what she had known her before .-- isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her . emma \\' s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on , by harriet \\' s being to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least . mr . and mrs . john knightley were to come down in august , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back . \" john does not even mention your friend ,\" said mr . knightley . \" here is his answer , if you like to see it .\" it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage . emma accepted it with a very eager hand , with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it , and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned . \" john enters like a brother into my happiness ,\" continued mr . knightley , \" but he is no complimenter ; and though i well know him to have , likewise , a most brotherly affection for you , he is so far from making flourishes , that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise . but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes .\" \" he writes like a sensible man ,\" replied emma , when she had read the letter . \" i honour his sincerity . it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side , but that he is not without hope of my growing , in time , as worthy of your affection , as you think me already . had he said any thing to bear a different construction , i should not have believed him .\" \" my emma , he means no such thing . he only means --\" \" he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two ,\" interrupted she , with a sort of serious smile --\" much less , perhaps , than he is aware of , if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject .\" \" emma , my dear emma --\" \" oh !\" she cried with more thorough gaiety , \" if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion . depend upon it , he will be much farther from doing _you_ justice . he will think all the happiness , all the advantage , on your side of the question ; all the merit on mine . i wish i may not sink into ` poor emma \\' with him at once .-- his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther .\" \" ah !\" he cried , \" i wish your father might be half as easily convinced as john will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together . i am amused by one part of john \\' s letter -- did you notice it ?-- where he says , that my information did not take him wholly by surprize , that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind .\" \" if i understand your brother , he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying . he had no idea of me . he seems perfectly unprepared for that .\" \" yes , yes -- but i am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings . what has he been judging by ?-- i am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another .-- but it was so , i suppose . i dare say there was a difference when i was staying with them the other day . i believe i did not play with the children quite so much as usual . i remember one evening the poor boys saying , ` uncle seems always tired now .\\'\" the time was coming when the news must spread farther , and other persons \\' reception of it tried . as soon as mrs . weston was sufficiently recovered to admit mr . woodhouse \\' s visits , emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause , resolved first to announce it at home , and then at randalls .-- but how to break it to her father at last !-- she had bound herself to do it , in such an hour of mr . knightley \\' s absence , or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her , and she must have put it off ; but mr . knightley was to come at such a time , and follow up the beginning she was to make .-- she was forced to speak , and to speak cheerfully too . she must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself . she must not appear to think it a misfortune .-- with all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and mr . knightley meant to marry ; by which means hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person \\' s company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and mrs . weston , best in the world . poor man !-- it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it . she was reminded , more than once , of having always said she would never marry , and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single ; and told of poor isabella , and poor miss taylor .-- but it would not do . emma hung about him affectionately , and smiled , and said it must be so ; and that he must not class her with isabella and mrs . weston , whose marriages taking them from hartfield , had , indeed , made a melancholy change : but she was not going from hartfield ; she should be always there ; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better ; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having mr . knightley always at hand , when he were once got used to the idea .-- did he not love mr . knightley very much ?-- he would not deny that he did , she was sure .-- whom did he ever want to consult on business but mr . knightley ?-- who was so useful to him , who so ready to write his letters , who so glad to assist him ?-- who so cheerful , so attentive , so attached to him ?-- would not he like to have him always on the spot ?-- yes . that was all very true . mr . knightley could not be there too often ; he should be glad to see him every day ;-- but they did see him every day as it was .-- why could not they go on as they had done ? mr . woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest .-- to emma \\' s entreaties and assurances succeeded mr . knightley \\' s , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion .-- they had all the assistance which isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and mrs . weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one -- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to mr . woodhouse \\' s mind .-- it was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other -- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place . mrs . weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event .-- she had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost .-- she had such a regard for mr . knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago .-- how very few of those men in a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own home for hartfield ! and who but mr . knightley could know and bear with mr . woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable !-- the difficulty of disposing of poor mr . woodhouse had been always felt in her husband \\' s plans and her own , for a marriage between frank and emma . how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had been a continual impediment -- less acknowledged by mr . weston than by herself -- but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying --\" those matters will take care of themselves ; the young people will find a way .\" but here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future . it was all right , all open , all equal . no sacrifice on any side worth the name . it was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself , and without one real , rational difficulty to oppose or delay it . mrs . weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world . if any thing could increase her delight , it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps . the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread ; and mr . weston had his five minutes share of it ; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind .-- he saw the advantages of the match , and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife ; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing ; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it . \" it is to be a secret , i conclude ,\" said he . \" these matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them . only let me be told when i may speak out .-- i wonder whether jane has any suspicion .\" he went to highbury the next morning , and satisfied himself on that point . he told her the news . was not she like a daughter , his eldest daughter ?-- he must tell her ; and miss bates being present , it passed , of course , to mrs . cole , mrs . perry , and mrs . elton , immediately afterwards . it was no more than the principals were prepared for ; they had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls , how soon it would be over highbury ; and were thinking of themselves , as the evening wonder in many a family circle , with great sagacity . in general , it was a very well approved match . some might think him , and others might think her , the most in luck . one set might recommend their all removing to donwell , and leaving hartfield for the john knightleys ; and another might predict disagreements among their servants ; but yet , upon the whole , there was no serious objection raised , except in one habitation , the vicarage .-- there , the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction . mr . elton cared little about it , compared with his wife ; he only hoped \" the young lady \\' s pride would now be contented ;\" and supposed \" she had always meant to catch knightley if she could ;\" and , on the point of living at hartfield , could daringly exclaim , \" rather he than i !\"-- but mrs . elton was very much discomposed indeed .--\" poor knightley ! poor fellow !-- sad business for him .-- she was extremely concerned ; for , though very eccentric , he had a thousand good qualities .-- how could he be so taken in ?-- did not think him at all in love -- not in the least .-- poor knightley !-- there would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him .-- how happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him ! but that would be all over now .-- poor fellow !-- no more exploring parties to donwell made for _her_ . oh ! no ; there would be a mrs . knightley to throw cold water on every thing .-- extremely disagreeable ! but she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day .-- shocking plan , living together . it would never do . she knew a family near maple grove who had tried it , and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter . chapter xviii time passed on . a few more to - morrows , and the party from london would be arriving . it was an alarming change ; and emma was thinking of it one morning , as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her , when mr . knightley came in , and distressing thoughts were put by . after the first chat of pleasure he was silent ; and then , in a graver tone , began with , \" i have something to tell you , emma ; some news .\" \" good or bad ?\" said she , quickly , looking up in his face . \" i do not know which it ought to be called .\" \" oh ! good i am sure .-- i see it in your countenance . you are trying not to smile .\" \" i am afraid ,\" said he , composing his features , \" i am very much afraid , my dear emma , that you will not smile when you hear it .\" \" indeed ! but why so ?-- i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too .\" \" there is one subject ,\" he replied , \" i hope but one , on which we do not think alike .\" he paused a moment , again smiling , with his eyes fixed on her face . \" does nothing occur to you ?-- do not you recollect ?-- harriet smith .\" her cheeks flushed at the name , and she felt afraid of something , though she knew not what . \" have you heard from her yourself this morning ?\" cried he . \" you have , i believe , and know the whole .\" \" no , i have not ; i know nothing ; pray tell me .\" \" you are prepared for the worst , i see -- and very bad it is . harriet smith marries robert martin .\" emma gave a start , which did not seem like being prepared -- and her eyes , in eager gaze , said , \" no , this is impossible !\" but her lips were closed . \" it is so , indeed ,\" continued mr . knightley ; \" i have it from robert martin himself . he left me not half an hour ago .\" she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement . \" you like it , my emma , as little as i feared .-- i wish our opinions were the same . but in time they will . time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject .\" \" you mistake me , you quite mistake me ,\" she replied , exerting herself . \" it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but i cannot believe it . it seems an impossibility !-- you cannot mean to say , that harriet smith has accepted robert martin . you cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet . you only mean , that he intends it .\" \" i mean that he has done it ,\" answered mr . knightley , with smiling but determined decision , \" and been accepted .\" \" good god !\" she cried .--\" well !\"-- then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , \" well , now tell me every thing ; make this intelligible to me . how , where , when ?-- let me know it all . i never was more surprized -- but it does not make me unhappy , i assure you .-- how -- how has it been possible ?\" \" it is a very simple story . he went to town on business three days ago , and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send to john .-- he delivered these papers to john , at his chambers , and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astley \\' s . they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley \\' s . the party was to be our brother and sister , henry , john -- and miss smith . my friend robert could not resist . they called for him in their way ; were all extremely amused ; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit ( as i understand ) he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet ; and certainly did not speak in vain .-- she made him , by her acceptance , as happy even as he is deserving . he came down by yesterday \\' s coach , and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast , to report his proceedings , first on my affairs , and then on his own . this is all that i can relate of the how , where , and when . your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her .-- she will give you all the minute particulars , which only woman \\' s language can make interesting .-- in our communications we deal only in the great .-- however , i must say , that robert martin \\' s heart seemed for _him_ , and to _me_ , very overflowing ; and that he did mention , without its being much to the purpose , that on quitting their box at astley \\' s , my brother took charge of mrs . john knightley and little john , and he followed with miss smith and henry ; and that at one time they were in such a crowd , as to make miss smith rather uneasy .\" he stopped .-- emma dared not attempt any immediate reply . to speak , she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness . she must wait a moment , or he would think her mad . her silence disturbed him ; and after observing her a little while , he added , \" emma , my love , you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy ; but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected . his situation is an evil -- but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend ; and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more . his good sense and good principles would delight you .-- as far as the man is concerned , you could not wish your friend in better hands . his rank in society i would alter if i could , which is saying a great deal i assure you , emma .-- you laugh at me about william larkins ; but i could quite as ill spare robert martin .\" he wanted her to look up and smile ; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly -- she did -- cheerfully answering , \" you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match . i think harriet is doing extremely well . _her_ connexions may be worse than _his_ . in respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are . i have been silent from surprize merely , excessive surprize . you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me ! how peculiarly unprepared i was !-- for i had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before .\" \" you ought to know your friend best ,\" replied mr . knightley ; \" but i should say she was a good - tempered , soft - hearted girl , not likely to be very , very determined against any young man who told her he loved her .\" emma could not help laughing as she answered , \" upon my word , i believe you know her quite as well as i do .-- but , mr . knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him . i could suppose she might in time -- but can she already ?-- did not you misunderstand him ?-- you were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills -- and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him ?-- it was not harriet \\' s hand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox .\" the contrast between the countenance and air of mr . knightley and robert martin was , at this moment , so strong to emma \\' s feelings , and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on harriet \\' s side , so fresh the sound of those words , spoken with such emphasis , \" no , i hope i know better than to think of robert martin ,\" that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove , in some measure , premature . it could not be otherwise . \" do you dare say this ?\" cried mr . knightley . \" do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of ?-- what do you deserve ?\" \" oh ! i always deserve the best treatment , because i never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer . are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which mr . martin and harriet now are ?\" \" i am quite sure ,\" he replied , speaking very distinctly , \" that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and i think i can give you a proof that it must be so . he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do . he knew of no one but mrs . goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends . could i mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to mrs . goddard ? i assured him that i could not . then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day .\" \" i am perfectly satisfied ,\" replied emma , with the brightest smiles , \" and most sincerely wish them happy .\" \" you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before .\" \" i hope so -- for at that time i was a fool .\" \" and i am changed also ; for i am now very willing to grant you all harriet \\' s good qualities . i have taken some pains for your sake , and for robert martin \\' s sake , ( whom i have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever ,) to get acquainted with her . i have often talked to her a good deal . you must have seen that i did . sometimes , indeed , i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor martin \\' s cause , which was never the case ; but , from all my observations , i am convinced of her being an artless , amiable girl , with very good notions , very seriously good principles , and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life .-- much of this , i have no doubt , she may thank you for .\" \" me !\" cried emma , shaking her head .--\" ah ! poor harriet !\" she checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved . their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father . she was not sorry . she wanted to be alone . her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected . she was in dancing , singing , exclaiming spirits ; and till she had moved about , and talked to herself , and laughed and reflected , she could be fit for nothing rational . her father \\' s business was to announce james \\' s being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing . the joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined . the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of harriet \\' s welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security .-- what had she to wish for ? nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own . nothing , but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future . serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them . she must laugh at such a close ! such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back ! such a heart -- such a harriet ! now there would be pleasure in her returning -- every thing would be a pleasure . it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin . high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from mr . knightley would soon be over . the disguise , equivocation , mystery , so hateful to her to practise , might soon be over . she could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty . in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day , or poor mrs . weston would be disappointed . they arrived .-- mrs . weston was alone in the drawing - room :-- but hardly had they been told of the baby , and mr . woodhouse received the thanks for coming , which he asked for , when a glimpse was caught through the blind , of two figures passing near the window . \" it is frank and miss fairfax ,\" said mrs . weston . \" i was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning . he stays till to - morrow , and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us .-- they are coming in , i hope .\" in half a minute they were in the room . emma was extremely glad to see him -- but there was a degree of confusion -- a number of embarrassing recollections on each side . they met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing frank churchill once more , and of seeing him with jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure . when mr . weston joined the party , however , and when the baby was fetched , there was no longer a want of subject or animation -- or of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her and say , \" i have to thank you , miss woodhouse , for a very kind forgiving message in one of mrs . weston \\' s letters . i hope time has not made you less willing to pardon . i hope you do not retract what you then said .\" \" no , indeed ,\" cried emma , most happy to begin , \" not in the least . i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you -- and to give you joy in person .\" he thanked her with all his heart , and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness . \" is not she looking well ?\" said he , turning his eyes towards jane . \" better than she ever used to do ?-- you see how my father and mrs . weston doat upon her .\" but his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the campbells , he named the name of dixon .-- emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing . \" i can never think of it ,\" she cried , \" without extreme shame .\" \" the shame ,\" he answered , \" is all mine , or ought to be . but is it possible that you had no suspicion ?-- i mean of late . early , i know , you had none .\" \" i never had the smallest , i assure you .\" \" that appears quite wonderful . i was once very near -- and i wish i had -- it would have been better . but though i was always doing wrong things , they were very bad wrong things , and such as did me no service .-- it would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing .\" \" it is not now worth a regret ,\" said emma . \" i have some hope ,\" resumed he , \" of my uncle \\' s being persuaded to pay a visit at randalls ; he wants to be introduced to her . when the campbells are returned , we shall meet them in london , and continue there , i trust , till we may carry her northward .-- but now , i am at such a distance from her -- is not it hard , miss woodhouse ?-- till this morning , we have not once met since the day of reconciliation . do not you pity me ?\" emma spoke her pity so very kindly , that with a sudden accession of gay thought , he cried , \" ah ! by the bye ,\" then sinking his voice , and looking demure for the moment --\" i hope mr . knightley is well ?\" he paused .-- she coloured and laughed .--\" i know you saw my letter , and think you may remember my wish in your favour . let me return your congratulations .-- i assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction .-- he is a man whom i cannot presume to praise .\" emma was delighted , and only wanted him to go on in the same style ; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own jane , and his next words were , \" did you ever see such a skin ?-- such smoothness ! such delicacy !-- and yet without being actually fair .-- one cannot call her fair . it is a most uncommon complexion , with her dark eye - lashes and hair -- a most distinguishing complexion ! so peculiarly the lady in it .-- just colour enough for beauty .\" \" i have always admired her complexion ,\" replied emma , archly ; \" but do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale ?-- when we first began to talk of her .-- have you quite forgotten ?\" \" oh ! no -- what an impudent dog i was !-- how could i dare --\" but he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that emma could not help saying , \" i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time , you had very great amusement in tricking us all .-- i am sure you had .-- i am sure it was a consolation to you .\" \" oh ! no , no , no -- how can you suspect me of such a thing ? i was the most miserable wretch !\" \" not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth . i am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you , to feel that you were taking us all in .-- perhaps i am the readier to suspect , because , to tell you the truth , i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation . i think there is a little likeness between us .\" he bowed . \" if not in our dispositions ,\" she presently added , with a look of true sensibility , \" there is a likeness in our destiny ; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own .\" \" true , true ,\" he answered , warmly . \" no , not true on your side . you can have no superior , but most true on mine .-- she is a complete angel . look at her . is not she an angel in every gesture ? observe the turn of her throat . observe her eyes , as she is looking up at my father .-- you will be glad to hear ( inclining his head , and whispering seriously ) that my uncle means to give her all my aunt \\' s jewels . they are to be new set . i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head . will not it be beautiful in her dark hair ?\" \" very beautiful , indeed ,\" replied emma ; and she spoke so kindly , that he gratefully burst out , \" how delighted i am to see you again ! and to see you in such excellent looks !-- i would not have missed this meeting for the world . i should certainly have called at hartfield , had you failed to come .\" the others had been talking of the child , mrs . weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant \\' s appearing not quite well . she believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for mr . perry . perhaps she ought to be ashamed , but mr . weston had been almost as uneasy as herself .-- in ten minutes , however , the child had been perfectly well again . this was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to mr . woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry , and only regretted that she had not done it . \" she should always send for perry , if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , were it only for a moment . she could not be too soon alarmed , nor send for perry too often . it was a pity , perhaps , that he had not come last night ; for , though the child seemed well now , very well considering , it would probably have been better if perry had seen it .\" frank churchill caught the name . \" perry !\" said he to emma , and trying , as he spoke , to catch miss fairfax \\' s eye . \" my friend mr . perry ! what are they saying about mr . perry ?-- has he been here this morning ?-- and how does he travel now ?-- has he set up his carriage ?\" emma soon recollected , and understood him ; and while she joined in the laugh , it was evident from jane \\' s countenance that she too was really hearing him , though trying to seem deaf . \" such an extraordinary dream of mine !\" he cried . \" i can never think of it without laughing .-- she hears us , she hears us , miss woodhouse . i see it in her cheek , her smile , her vain attempt to frown . look at her . do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye -- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ?\" jane was forced to smile completely , for a moment ; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him , and said in a conscious , low , yet steady voice , \" how you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me !-- they _will_ sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them !\" he had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but emma \\' s feelings were chiefly with jane , in the argument ; and on leaving randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of mr . knightley \\' s high superiority of character . the happiness of this most happy day , received its completion , in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced . chapter xix if emma had still , at intervals , an anxious feeling for harriet , a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to mr . knightley , and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination , it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty . a very few days brought the party from london , and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet , than she became perfectly satisfied -- unaccountable as it was !-- that robert martin had thoroughly supplanted mr . knightley , and was now forming all her views of happiness . harriet was a little distressed -- did look a little foolish at first : but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly , and self - deceived , before , her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words , and leave her without a care for the past , and with the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for , as to her friend \\' s approbation , emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations .-- harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at astley \\' s , and the dinner the next day ; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight . but what did such particulars explain ?-- the fact was , as emma could now acknowledge , that harriet had always liked robert martin ; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible .-- beyond this , it must ever be unintelligible to emma . the event , however , was most joyful ; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so .-- harriet \\' s parentage became known . she proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment .-- such was the blood of gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for !-- it was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for mr . knightley -- or for the churchills -- or even for mr . elton !-- the stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth , would have been a stain indeed . no objection was raised on the father \\' s side ; the young man was treated liberally ; it was all as it should be : and as emma became acquainted with robert martin , who was now introduced at hartfield , she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend . she had no doubt of harriet \\' s happiness with any good - tempered man ; but with him , and in the home he offered , there would be the hope of more , of security , stability , and improvement . she would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness . she would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out . she would be respectable and happy ; and emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man ;-- or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself . harriet , necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins , was less and less at hartfield ; which was not to be regretted .-- the intimacy between her and emma must sink ; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill ; and , fortunately , what ought to be , and must be , seemed already beginning , and in the most gradual , natural manner . before the end of september , emma attended harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with mr . elton as he stood before them , could impair .-- perhaps , indeed , at that time she scarcely saw mr . elton , but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself .-- robert martin and harriet smith , the latest couple engaged of the three , were the first to be married . jane fairfax had already quitted highbury , and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the campbells .-- the mr . churchills were also in town ; and they were only waiting for november . the intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by emma and mr . knightley .-- they had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield , to allow them the fortnight \\' s absence in a tour to the seaside , which was the plan .-- john and isabella , and every other friend , were agreed in approving it . but mr . woodhouse -- how was mr . woodhouse to be induced to consent ?-- he , who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event . when first sounded on the subject , he was so miserable , that they were almost hopeless .-- a second allusion , indeed , gave less pain .-- he began to think it was to be , and that he could not prevent it -- a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation . still , however , he was not happy . nay , he appeared so much otherwise , that his daughter \\' s courage failed . she could not bear to see him suffering , to know him fancying himself neglected ; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the mr . knightleys , that when once the event were over , his distress would be soon over too , she hesitated -- she could not proceed . in this state of suspense they were befriended , not by any sudden illumination of mr . woodhouse \\' s mind , or any wonderful change of his nervous system , but by the operation of the same system in another way .-- mrs . weston \\' s poultry - house was robbed one night of all her turkeys -- evidently by the ingenuity of man . other poultry - yards in the neighbourhood also suffered .-- pilfering was _housebreaking_ to mr . woodhouse \\' s fears .-- he was very uneasy ; and but for the sense of his son - in - law \\' s protection , would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life . the strength , resolution , and presence of mind of the mr . knightleys , commanded his fullest dependence . while either of them protected him and his , hartfield was safe .-- but mr . john knightley must be in london again by the end of the first week in november . the result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding - day -- and mr . elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of mr . and mrs . robert martin , to join the hands of mr . knightley and miss woodhouse . the wedding was very much like other weddings , where the parties have no taste for finery or parade ; and mrs . elton , from the particulars detailed by her husband , thought it all extremely shabby , and very inferior to her own .--\" very little white satin , very few lace veils ; a most pitiful business !-- selina would stare when she heard of it .\"-- but , in spite of these deficiencies , the wishes , the hopes , the confidence , the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony , were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union . finis [ the tragedie of hamlet by william shakespeare 1599 ] actus primus . scoena prima . enter barnardo and francisco two centinels . barnardo . who \\' s there ? fran . nay answer me : stand & vnfold your selfe bar . long liue the king fran . barnardo ? bar . he fran . you come most carefully vpon your houre bar . \\' tis now strook twelue , get thee to bed francisco fran . for this releefe much thankes : \\' tis bitter cold , and i am sicke at heart barn . haue you had quiet guard ? fran . not a mouse stirring barn . well , goodnight . if you do meet horatio and marcellus , the riuals of my watch , bid them make hast . enter horatio and marcellus . fran . i thinke i heare them . stand : who \\' s there ? hor . friends to this ground mar . and leige - men to the dane fran . giue you good night mar . o farwel honest soldier , who hath relieu \\' d you ? fra . barnardo ha \\' s my place : giue you goodnight . exit fran . mar . holla barnardo bar . say , what is horatio there ? hor . a peece of him bar . welcome horatio , welcome good marcellus mar . what , ha \\' s this thing appear \\' d againe to night bar . i haue seene nothing mar . horatio saies , \\' tis but our fantasie , and will not let beleefe take hold of him touching this dreaded sight , twice seene of vs , therefore i haue intreated him along with vs , to watch the minutes of this night , that if againe this apparition come , he may approue our eyes , and speake to it hor . tush , tush , \\' twill not appeare bar . sit downe a - while , and let vs once againe assaile your eares , that are so fortified against our story , what we two nights haue seene hor . well , sit we downe , and let vs heare barnardo speake of this barn . last night of all , when yond same starre that \\' s westward from the pole had made his course t \\' illume that part of heauen where now it burnes , marcellus and my selfe , the bell then beating one mar . peace , breake thee of : enter the ghost . looke where it comes againe barn . in the same figure , like the king that \\' s dead mar . thou art a scholler ;

who ? hor . my lord , the king your father ham . the king my father ? hor . season your admiration for a while with an attent eare ; till i may deliuer vpon the witnesse of these gentlemen , this maruell to you ham . for heauens loue let me heare hor . two nights together , had these gentlemen ( marcellus and barnardo ) on their watch in the dead wast and middle of the night beene thus encountred . a figure like your father , arm \\' d at all points exactly , cap a pe , appeares before them , and with sollemne march goes slow and stately : by them thrice he walkt , by their opprest and feare - surprized eyes , within his truncheons length ; whilst they bestil \\' d almost to ielly with the act of feare , stand dumbe and speake not to him . this to me in dreadfull secrecie impart they did , and i with them the third night kept the watch , whereas they had deliuer \\' d both in time , forme of the thing ; each word made true and good , the apparition comes . i knew your father : these hands are not more like ham . but where was this ? mar . my lord vpon the platforme where we watcht ham . did you not speake to it ? hor . my lord , i did ; but answere made it none : yet once me thought it lifted vp it head , and did addresse it selfe to motion , like as it would speake : but euen then , the morning cocke crew lowd ; and at the sound it shrunke in hast away , and vanisht from our sight ham . tis very strange hor . as i doe liue my honourd lord \\' tis true ; and we did thinke it writ downe in our duty to let you know of it ham . indeed , indeed sirs ; but this troubles me . hold you the watch to night ?

laer . for hamlet , and the trifling of his fauours , hold it a fashion and a toy in bloude ; a violet in the youth of primy nature ; froward , not permanent ; sweet not lasting the suppliance of a minute ? no more ophel . no more but so laer . thinke it no more : for nature cressant does not grow alone , in thewes and bulke : but as his temple waxes , the inward seruice of the minde and soule growes wide withall . perhaps he loues you now , and now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch the vertue of his feare : but you must feare his greatnesse weigh \\' d , his will is not his owne ; for hee himselfe is subiect to his birth : hee may not , as vnuallued persons doe , carue for himselfe ; for , on his choyce depends the sanctity and health of the whole state . and therefore must his choyce be circumscrib \\' d vnto the voyce and yeelding of that body , whereof he is the head . then if he sayes he loues you , it fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it ; as he in his peculiar sect and force may giue his saying deed : which is no further , then the maine voyce of denmarke goes withall . then weight what losse your honour may sustaine , if with too credent eare you list his songs ; or lose your heart ; or your chast treasure open to his vnmastred importunity . feare it ophelia , feare it my deare sister , and keepe within the reare of your affection ; out of the shot and danger of desire . the chariest maid is prodigall enough , if she vnmaske her beauty to the moone : vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes , the canker galls , the infants of the spring too oft before the buttons be disclos \\' d , and in the morne and liquid dew of youth , contagious blastments are most imminent . be wary then , best safety lies in feare ; youth to it selfe rebels , though none else neere ophe . i shall th \\' effect of this good lesson keepe , as watchmen to my heart : but good my brother doe not as some vngracious pastors doe , shew me the steepe and thorny way to heauen ; whilst like a puft and recklesse libertine himselfe , the primrose path of dalliance treads , and reaks not his owne reade laer . oh , feare me not . enter polonius . i stay too long ; but here my father comes : a double blessing is a double grace ; occasion smiles vpon a second leaue polon . yet heere laertes ? aboord , aboord for shame , the winde sits in the shoulder of your saile , and you are staid for there : my blessing with you ; and these few precepts in thy memory , see thou character . giue thy thoughts no tongue , nor any vnproportion \\' d thoughts his act : be thou familiar ; but by no meanes vulgar : the friends thou hast , and their adoption tride , grapple them to thy soule , with hoopes of steele : but doe not dull thy palme , with entertainment of each vnhatch \\' t , vnfledg \\' d comrade . beware of entrance to a quarrell : but being in bear \\' t that th \\' opposed may beware of thee . giue euery man thine eare ; but few thy voyce : take each mans censure ; but reserue thy iudgement : costly thy habit as thy purse can buy ; but not exprest in fancie ; rich , not gawdie : for the apparell oft proclaimes the man . and they in france of the best ranck and station , are of a most select and generous cheff in that . neither a borrower , nor a lender be ; for lone oft loses both it selfe and friend : and borrowing duls the edge of husbandry . this aboue all ; to thine owne selfe be true : and it must follow , as the night the day , thou canst not then be false to any man . farewell : my blessing season this in thee laer . most humbly doe i take my leaue , my lord polon . the time inuites you , goe , your seruants tend laer . farewell ophelia , and remember well what i haue said to you ophe . tis in my memory lockt , and you your selfe shall keepe the key of it laer . farewell . exit laer . polon . what ist ophelia he hath said to you ?

laer . i \\' m lost in it my lord ; but let him come , it warmes the very sicknesse in my heart , that i shall liue and tell him to his teeth ; thus diddest thou kin . if it be so laertes , as how should it be so : how otherwise will you be rul \\' d by me ? laer . if so you \\' l not o \\' rerule me to a peace kin . to thine owne peace : if he be now return \\' d , as checking at his voyage , and that he meanes no more to vndertake it ; i will worke him to an exployt now ripe in my deuice , vnder the which he shall not choose but fall ; and for his death no winde of blame shall breath , but euen his mother shall vncharge the practice , and call it accident : some two monthes hence here was a gentleman of normandy , i \\' ue seene my selfe , and seru \\' d against the french , and they ran well on horsebacke ; but this gallant had witchcraft in \\' t ; he grew into his seat , and to such wondrous doing brought his horse , as had he beene encorps \\' t and demy - natur \\' d with the braue beast , so farre he past my thought , that i in forgery of shapes and trickes , come short of what he did laer . a norman was \\' t ? kin . a norman laer . vpon my life lamound kin . the very same laer . i know him well , he is the brooch indeed , and iemme of all our nation kin . hee mad confession of you , and gaue you such a masterly report , for art and exercise in your defence ; and for your rapier most especiall , that he cryed out , t \\' would be a sight indeed , if one could match you sir . this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his enuy , that he could nothing doe but wish and begge , your sodaine comming ore to play with him ; now out of this laer . why out of this , my lord ? kin . laertes was your father deare to you ? or are you like the painting of a sorrow , a face without a heart ? laer . why aske you this ? kin . not that i thinke you did not loue your father , but that i know loue is begun by time : and that i see in passages of proofe , time qualifies the sparke and fire of it : hamlet comes backe : what would you vndertake , to show your selfe your fathers sonne indeed , more then in words ? laer . to cut his throat i \\' th \\' church kin . no place indeed should murder sancturize ; reuenge should haue no bounds : but good laertes will you doe this , keepe close within your chamber , hamlet return \\' d , shall know you are come home : wee \\' l put on those shall praise your excellence , and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gaue you , bring you in fine together , and wager on your heads , he being remisse , most generous , and free from all contriuing , will not peruse the foiles ? so that with ease , or with a little shuffling , you may choose a sword vnbaited , and in a passe of practice , requit him for your father laer . i will doo \\' t . and for that purpose ile annoint my sword : i bought an vnction of a mountebanke so mortall , i but dipt a knife in it , where it drawes blood , no cataplasme so rare , collected from all simples that haue vertue vnder the moone , can saue the thing from death , that is but scratcht withall : ile touch my point , with this contagion , that if i gall him slightly , it may be death kin . let \\' s further thinke of this , weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes may fit vs to our shape , if this should faile ; and that our drift looke through our bad performance , \\' twere better not assaid ; therefore this proiect should haue a backe or second , that might hold , if this should blast in proofe : soft , let me see wee \\' l make a solemne wager on your commings , i ha \\' t : when in your motion you are hot and dry , as make your bowts more violent to the end , and that he cals for drinke ; ile haue prepar \\' d him a challice for the nonce ; whereon but sipping , if he by chance escape your venom \\' d stuck , our purpose may hold there ; how sweet queene . enter queene . queen . one woe doth tread vpon anothers heele , so fast they \\' l follow : your sister \\' s drown \\' d laertes laer . drown \\' d ! o where ? queen . there is a willow growes aslant a brooke , that shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame : there with fantasticke garlands did she come , of crow - flowers , nettles , daysies , and long purples , that liberall shepheards giue a grosser name ; but our cold maids doe dead mens fingers call them : there on the pendant boughes , her coronet weeds clambring to hang ; an enuious sliuer broke , when downe the weedy trophies , and her selfe , fell in the weeping brooke , her cloathes spred wide , and mermaid - like , a while they bore her vp , which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes , as one incapable of her owne distresse , or like a creature natiue , and indued vnto that element : but long it could not be , till that her garments , heauy with her drinke , pul \\' d the poore wretch from her melodious buy , to muddy death laer . alas then , is she drown \\' d ? queen . drown \\' d , drown \\' d laer . too much of water hast thou poore ophelia , and therefore i forbid my teares : but yet it is our tricke , nature her custome holds , let shame say what it will ; when these are gone the woman will be out : adue my lord , i haue a speech of fire , that faine would blaze , but that this folly doubts it . enter . kin . let \\' s follow , gertrude : how much i had to doe to calme his rage ?

other . why \\' tis found so clo . it must be se offendendo , it cannot bee else : for heere lies the point ; if i drowne my selfe wittingly , it argues an act : and an act hath three branches . it is an act to doe and to performe ; argall she drown \\' d her selfe wittingly other . nay but heare you goodman deluer clown . giue me leaue ; heere lies the water ; good : heere stands the man ; good : if the man goe to this water and drowne himselfe ; it is will he nill he , he goes ; marke you that ?

hum . this fellow might be in \\' s time a great buyer of land , with his statutes , his recognizances , his fines , his double vouchers , his recoueries : is this the fine of his fines , and the recouery of his recoueries , to haue his fine pate full of fine dirt ? will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases , and double ones too , then the length and breadth of a paire of indentures ? the very conueyances of his lands will hardly lye in this boxe ; and must the inheritor himselfe haue no more ?

hor . i , good my lord ham . an earnest coniuration from the king , as england was his faithfull tributary , as loue betweene them , as the palme should flourish , as peace should still her wheaten garland weare , and stand a comma \\' tweene their amities , and many such like assis of great charge , that on the view and know of these contents , without debatement further , more or lesse , he should the bearers put to sodaine death , not shriuing time allowed hor . how was this seal \\' d ?

of week days pent up in lath and plaster -- tied to counters , nailed to benches , clinched to desks . how then is this ? are the green fields gone ? what do they here ? but look ! here come more crowds , pacing straight for the water , and seemingly bound for a dive . strange ! nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land ; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice . no . they must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in . and there they stand -- miles of them -- leagues . inlanders all , they come from lanes and alleys , streets and avenues -- north , east , south , and west . yet here they all unite . tell me , does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither ? once more . say you are in the country ; in some high land of lakes . take almost any path you please , and ten to one it carries you down in a dale , and leaves you there by a pool in the stream . there is magic in it . let the most absent - minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries -- stand that man on his legs , set his feet a - going , and he will infallibly lead you to water , if water there be in all that region . should you ever be athirst in the great american desert , try this experiment , if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor . yes , as every one knows , meditation and water are wedded for ever . but here is an artist . he desires to paint you the dreamiest , shadiest , quietest , most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the saco . what is the chief element he employs ? there stand his trees , each with a hollow trunk , as if a hermit and a crucifix were within ; and here sleeps his meadow , and there sleep his cattle ; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke . deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way , reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill - side blue . but though the picture lies thus tranced , and though this pine - tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd \\' s head , yet all were vain , unless the shepherd \\' s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him . go visit the prairies in june , when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee - deep among tiger - lilies -- what is the one charm wanting ?-- water -- there is not a drop of water there ! were niagara but a cataract of sand , would you travel your thousand miles to see it ? why did the poor poet of tennessee , upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver , deliberate whether to buy him a coat , which he sadly needed , or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach ? why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him , at some time or other crazy to go to sea ? why upon your first voyage as a passenger , did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration , when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land ? why did the old persians hold the sea holy ? why did the greeks give it a separate deity , and own brother of jove ? surely all this is not without meaning . and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus , who because he could not grasp the tormenting , mild image he saw in the fountain , plunged into it and was drowned . but that same image , we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans . it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life ; and this is the key to it all . now , when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes , and begin to be over conscious of my lungs , i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger . for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse , and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it . besides , passengers get sea - sick -- grow quarrelsome -- don \\' t sleep of nights -- do not enjoy themselves much , as a general thing ;-- no , i never go as a passenger ; nor , though i am something of a salt , do i ever go to sea as a commodore , or a captain , or a cook . i abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them . for my part , i abominate all honourable respectable toils , trials , and tribulations of every kind whatsoever . it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself , without taking care of ships , barques , brigs , schooners , and what not . and as for going as cook ,-- though i confess there is considerable glory in that , a cook being a sort of officer on ship - board -- yet , somehow , i never fancied broiling fowls ;-- though once broiled , judiciously buttered , and judgmatically salted and peppered , there is no one who will speak more respectfully , not to say reverentially , of a broiled fowl than i will . it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse , that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake - houses the pyramids . no , when i go to sea , i go as a simple sailor , right before the mast , plumb down into the forecastle , aloft there to the royal mast - head . true , they rather order me about some , and make me jump from spar to spar , like a grasshopper in a may meadow . and at first , this sort of thing is unpleasant enough . it touches one \\' s sense of honour , particularly if you come of an old established family in the land , the van rensselaers , or randolphs , or hardicanutes . and more than all , if just previous to putting your hand into the tar - pot , you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster , making the tallest boys stand in awe of you . the transition is a keen one , i assure you , from a schoolmaster to a sailor , and requires a strong decoction of seneca and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it . but even this wears off in time . what of it , if some old hunks of a sea - captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks ? what does that indignity amount to , weighed , i mean , in the scales of the new testament ? do you think the archangel gabriel thinks anything the less of me , because i promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance ? who ain \\' t a slave ? tell me that . well , then , however the old sea - captains may order me about -- however they may thump and punch me about , i have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right ; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way -- either in a physical or metaphysical point of view , that is ; and so the universal thump is passed round , and all hands should rub each other \\' s shoulder - blades , and be content . again , i always go to sea as a sailor , because they make a point of paying me for my trouble , whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that i ever heard of . on the contrary , passengers themselves must pay . and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid . the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us . but being paid ,-- what will compare with it ? the urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous , considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills , and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven . ah ! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition ! finally , i always go to sea as a sailor , because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore - castle deck . for as in this world , head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern ( that is , if you never violate the pythagorean maxim ), so for the most part the commodore on the quarter - deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle . he thinks he breathes it first ; but not so . in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things , at the same time that the leaders little suspect it . but wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor , i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage ; this the invisible police officer of the fates , who has the constant surveillance of me , and secretly dogs me , and influences me in some unaccountable way -- he can better answer than any one else . and , doubtless , my going on this whaling voyage , formed part of the grand programme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago . it came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances . i take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this : \" grand contested election for the presidency of the united states . \" whaling voyage by one ishmael . \" bloody battle in affghanistan .\" though i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers , the fates , put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage , when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies , and short and easy parts in genteel comedies , and jolly parts in farces -- though i cannot tell why this was exactly ; yet , now that i recall all the circumstances , i think i can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises , induced me to set about performing the part i did , besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment . chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself . such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity . then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk ; the undeliverable , nameless perils of the whale ; these , with all the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds , helped to sway me to my wish . with other men , perhaps , such things would not have been inducements ; but as for me , i am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote . i love to sail forbidden seas , and land on barbarous coasts . not ignoring what is good , i am quick to perceive a horror , and could still be social with it -- would they let me -- since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in . by reason of these things , then , the whaling voyage was welcome ; the great flood - gates of the wonder - world swung open , and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose , two and two there floated into my inmost soul , endless processions of the whale , and , mid most of them all , one grand hooded phantom , like a snow hill in the air . chapter 2 the carpet - bag . i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet - bag , tucked it under my arm , and started for cape horn and the pacific . quitting the good city of old manhatto , i duly arrived in new bedford . it was a saturday night in december . much was i disappointed upon learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed , and that no way of reaching that place would offer , till the following monday . as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same new bedford , thence to embark on their voyage , it may as well be related that i , for one , had no idea of so doing . for my mind was made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft , because there was a fine , boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island , which amazingly pleased me . besides though new bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling , and though in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her , yet nantucket was her great original -- the tyre of this carthage ;-- the place where the first dead american whale was stranded . where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen , the red - men , first sally out in canoes to give chase to the leviathan ? and where but from nantucket , too , did that first adventurous little sloop put forth , partly laden with imported cobblestones -- so goes the story -- to throw at the whales , in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit ? now having a night , a day , and still another night following before me in new bedford , ere i could embark for my destined port , it became a matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile . it was a very dubious - looking , nay , a very dark and dismal night , bitingly cold and cheerless . i knew no one in the place . with anxious grapnels i had sounded my pocket , and only brought up a few pieces of silver ,-- so , wherever you go , ishmael , said i to myself , as i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag , and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south -- wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night , my dear ishmael , be sure to inquire the price , and don \\' t be too particular . with halting steps i paced the streets , and passed the sign of \" the crossed harpoons \"-- but it looked too expensive and jolly there . further on , from the bright red windows of the \" sword - fish inn ,\" there came such fervent rays , that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house , for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard , asphaltic pavement ,-- rather weary for me , when i struck my foot against the flinty projections , because from hard , remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight . too expensive and jolly , again thought i , pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street , and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within . but go on , ishmael , said i at last ; don \\' t you hear ? get away from before the door ; your patched boots are stopping the way . so on i went . i now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward , for there , doubtless , were the cheapest , if not the cheeriest inns . such dreary streets ! blocks of blackness , not houses , on either hand , and here and there a candle , like a candle moving about in a tomb . at this hour of the night , of the last day of the week , that quarter of the town proved all but deserted . but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low , wide building , the door of which stood invitingly open . it had a careless look , as if it were meant for the uses of the public ; so , entering , the first thing i did was to stumble over an ash - box in the porch . ha ! thought i , ha , as the flying particles almost choked me , are these ashes from that destroyed city , gomorrah ? but \" the crossed harpoons ,\" and \" the sword - fish ?\"-- this , then must needs be the sign of \" the trap .\" however , i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within , pushed on and opened a second , interior door . it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet . a hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer ; and beyond , a black angel of doom was beating a book in a pulpit . it was a negro church ; and the preacher \\' s text was about the blackness of darkness , and the weeping and wailing and teeth - gnashing there . ha , ishmael , muttered i , backing out , wretched entertainment at the sign of \\' the trap !\\' moving on , i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks , and heard a forlorn creaking in the air ; and looking up , saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it , faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray , and these words underneath --\" the spouter inn :-- peter coffin .\" coffin ?-- spouter ?-- rather ominous in that particular connexion , thought i . but it is a common name in nantucket , they say , and i suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there . as the light looked so dim , and the place , for the time , looked quiet enough , and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district , and as the swinging sign had a poverty - stricken sort of creak to it , i thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings , and the best of pea coffee . it was a queer sort of place -- a gable - ended old house , one side palsied as it were , and leaning over sadly . it stood on a sharp bleak corner , where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor paul \\' s tossed craft . euroclydon , nevertheless , is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in - doors , with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed . \" in judging of that tempestuous wind called euroclydon ,\" says an old writer -- of whose works i possess the only copy extant --\" it maketh a marvellous difference , whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside , or whether thou observest it from that sashless window , where the frost is on both sides , and of which the wight death is the only glazier .\" true enough , thought i , as this passage occurred to my mind -- old black - letter , thou reasonest well . yes , these eyes are windows , and this body of mine is the house . what a pity they didn \\' t stop up the chinks and the crannies though , and thrust in a little lint here and there . but it \\' s too late to make any improvements now . the universe is finished ; the copestone is on , and the chips were carted off a million years ago . poor lazarus there , chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow , and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings , he might plug up both ears with rags , and put a corn - cob into his mouth , and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous euroclydon . euroclydon ! says old dives , in his red silken wrapper --( he had a redder one afterwards ) pooh , pooh ! what a fine frosty night ; how orion glitters ; what northern lights ! let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories ; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals . but what thinks lazarus ? can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights ? would not lazarus rather be in sumatra than here ? would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator ; yea , ye gods ! go down to the fiery pit itself , in order to keep out this frost ? now , that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of dives , this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the moluccas . yet dives himself , he too lives like a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs , and being a president of a temperance society , he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans . but no more of this blubbering now , we are going a - whaling , and there is plenty of that yet to come . let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet , and see what sort of a place this \" spouter \" may be . chapter 3 the spouter - inn . entering that gable - ended spouter - inn , you found yourself in a wide , low , straggling entry with old - fashioned wainscots , reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft . on one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked , and every way defaced , that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it , it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it , and careful inquiry of the neighbors , that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose . such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows , that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist , in the time of the new england hags , had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched . but by dint of much and earnest contemplation , and oft repeated ponderings , and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry , you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea , however wild , might not be altogether unwarranted . but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long , limber , portentous , black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue , dim , perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast . a boggy , soggy , squitchy picture truly , enough to drive a nervous man distracted . yet was there a sort of indefinite , half - attained , unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it , till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant . ever and anon a bright , but , alas , deceptive idea would dart you through .-- it \\' s the black sea in a midnight gale .-- it \\' s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements .-- it \\' s a blasted heath .-- it \\' s a hyperborean winter scene .-- it \\' s the breaking - up of the icebound stream of time . but at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture \\' s midst . that once found out , and all the rest were plain . but stop ; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish ? even the great leviathan himself ? in fact , the artist \\' s design seemed this : a final theory of my own , partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom i conversed upon the subject . the picture represents a cape - horner in a great hurricane ; the half - foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible ; and an exasperated whale , purposing to spring clean over the craft , is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast - heads . the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears . some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws ; others were tufted with knots of human hair ; and one was sickle - shaped , with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new - mown grass by a long - armed mower . you shuddered as you gazed , and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death - harvesting with such a hacking , horrifying implement . mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed . some were storied weapons . with this once long lance , now wildly elbowed , fifty years ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset . and that harpoon -- so like a corkscrew now -- was flung in javan seas , and run away with by a whale , years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco . the original iron entered nigh the tail , and , like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man , travelled full forty feet , and at last was found imbedded in the hump . crossing this dusky entry , and on through yon low - arched way -- cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round -- you enter the public room . a still duskier place is this , with such low ponderous beams above , and such old wrinkled planks beneath , that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft \\' s cockpits , especially of such a howling night , when this corner - anchored old ark rocked so furiously . on one side stood a long , low , shelf - like table covered with cracked glass cases , filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world \\' s remotest nooks . projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark - looking den -- the bar -- a rude attempt at a right whale \\' s head . be that how it may , there stands the vast arched bone of the whale \\' s jaw , so wide , a coach might almost drive beneath it . within are shabby shelves , ranged round with old decanters , bottles , flasks ; and in those jaws of swift destruction , like another cursed jonah ( by which name indeed they called him ), bustles a little withered old man , who , for their money , dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death . abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison . though true cylinders without -- within , the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom . parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass , surround these footpads \\' goblets . fill to this mark , and your charge is but a penny ; to this a penny more ; and so on to the full glass -- the cape horn measure , which you may gulp down for a shilling . upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about a table , examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander . i sought the landlord , and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a room , received for answer that his house was full -- not a bed unoccupied . \" but avast ,\" he added , tapping his forehead , \" you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer \\' s blanket , have ye ? i s \\' pose you are goin \\' a - whalin \\', so you \\' d better get used to that sort of thing .\" i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed ; that if i should ever do so , it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be , and that if he ( the landlord ) really had no other place for me , and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable , why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night , i would put up with the half of any decent man \\' s blanket . \" i thought so . all right ; take a seat . supper ?-- you want supper ? supper \\' ll be ready directly .\" i sat down on an old wooden settle , carved all over like a bench on the battery . at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack - knife , stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs . he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail , but he didn \\' t make much headway , i thought . at last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room . it was cold as iceland -- no fire at all -- the landlord said he couldn \\' t afford it . nothing but two dismal tallow candles , each in a winding sheet . we were fain to button up our monkey jackets , and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers . but the fare was of the most substantial kind -- not only meat and potatoes , but dumplings ; good heavens ! dumplings for supper ! one young fellow in a green box coat , addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner . \" my boy ,\" said the landlord , \" you \\' ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty .\" \" landlord ,\" i whispered , \" that aint the harpooneer is it ?\" \" oh , no ,\" said he , looking a sort of diabolically funny , \" the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap . he never eats dumplings , he don \\' t -- he eats nothing but steaks , and he likes \\' em rare .\" \" the devil he does ,\" says i . \" where is that harpooneer ? is he here ?\" \" he \\' ll be here afore long ,\" was the answer . i could not help it , but i began to feel suspicious of this \" dark complexioned \" harpooneer . at any rate , i made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together , he must undress and get into bed before i did . supper over , the company went back to the bar - room , when , knowing not what else to do with myself , i resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on . presently a rioting noise was heard without . starting up , the landlord cried , \" that \\' s the grampus \\' s crew . i seed her reported in the offing this morning ; a three years \\' voyage , and a full ship . hurrah , boys ; now we \\' ll have the latest news from the feegees .\" a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry ; the door was flung open , and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough . enveloped in their shaggy watch coats , and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters , all bedarned and ragged , and their beards stiff with icicles , they seemed an eruption of bears from labrador . they had just landed from their boat , and this was the first house they entered . no wonder , then , that they made a straight wake for the whale \\' s mouth -- the bar -- when the wrinkled little old jonah , there officiating , soon poured them out brimmers all round . one complained of a bad cold in his head , upon which jonah mixed him a pitch - like potion of gin and molasses , which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever , never mind of how long standing , or whether caught off the coast of labrador , or on the weather side of an ice - island . the liquor soon mounted into their heads , as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea , and they began capering about most obstreperously . i observed , however , that one of them held somewhat aloof , and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face , yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest . this man interested me at once ; and since the sea - gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate ( though but a sleeping - partner one , so far as this narrative is concerned ), i will here venture upon a little description of him . he stood full six feet in height , with noble shoulders , and a chest like a coffer - dam . i have seldom seen such brawn in a man . his face was deeply brown and burnt , making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast ; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy . his voice at once announced that he was a southerner , and from his fine stature , i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the alleghanian ridge in virginia . when the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height , this man slipped away unobserved , and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea . in a few minutes , however , he was missed by his shipmates , and being , it seems , for some reason a huge favourite with them , they raised a cry of \" bulkington ! bulkington ! where \\' s bulkington ?\" and darted out of the house in pursuit of him . it was now about nine o \\' clock , and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies , i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen . no man prefers to sleep two in a bed . in fact , you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother . i don \\' t know how it is , but people like to be private when they are sleeping . and when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger , in a strange inn , in a strange town , and that stranger a harpooneer , then your objections indefinitely multiply . nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should sleep two in a bed , more than anybody else ; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea , than bachelor kings do ashore . to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment , but you have your own hammock , and cover yourself with your own blanket , and sleep in your own skin . the more i pondered over this harpooneer , the more i abominated the thought of sleeping with him . it was fair to presume that being a harpooneer , his linen or woollen , as the case might be , would not be of the tidiest , certainly none of the finest . i began to twitch all over . besides , it was getting late , and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards . suppose now , he should tumble in upon me at midnight -- how could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming ? \" landlord ! i \\' ve changed my mind about that harpooneer .-- i shan \\' t sleep with him . i \\' ll try the bench here .\" \" just as you please ; i \\' m sorry i cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress , and it \\' s a plaguy rough board here \"-- feeling of the knots and notches . \" but wait a bit , skrimshander ; i \\' ve got a carpenter \\' s plane there in the bar -- wait , i say , and i \\' ll make ye snug enough .\" so saying he procured the plane ; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench , vigorously set to planing away at my bed , the while grinning like an ape . the shavings flew right and left ; till at last the plane - iron came bump against an indestructible knot . the landlord was near spraining his wrist , and i told him for heaven \\' s sake to quit -- the bed was soft enough to suit me , and i did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank . so gathering up the shavings with another grin , and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room , he went about his business , and left me in a brown study . i now took the measure of the bench , and found that it was a foot too short ; but that could be mended with a chair . but it was a foot too narrow , and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one -- so there was no yoking them . i then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall , leaving a little interval between , for my back to settle down in . but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window , that this plan would never do at all , especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window , and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night . the devil fetch that harpooneer , thought i , but stop , couldn \\' t i steal a march on him -- bolt his door inside , and jump into his bed , not to be wakened by the most violent knockings ? it seemed no bad idea ; but upon second thoughts i dismissed it . for who could tell but what the next morning , so soon as i popped out of the room , the harpooneer might be standing in the entry , all ready to knock me down ! still , looking round me again , and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person \\' s bed , i began to think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer . thinks i , i \\' ll wait awhile ; he must be dropping in before long . i \\' ll have a good look at him then , and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all -- there \\' s no telling . but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones , twos , and threes , and going to bed , yet no sign of my harpooneer . \" landlord ! said i , \" what sort of a chap is he -- does he always keep such late hours ?\" it was now hard upon twelve o \\' clock . the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle , and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension . \" no ,\" he answered , \" generally he \\' s an early bird -- airley to bed and airley to rise -- yes , he \\' s the bird what catches the worm . but to - night he went out a peddling , you see , and i don \\' t see what on airth keeps him so late , unless , may be , he can \\' t sell his head .\" \" can \\' t sell his head ?-- what sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me ?\" getting into a towering rage . \" do you pretend to say , landlord , that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed saturday night , or rather sunday morning , in peddling his head around this town ?\" \" that \\' s precisely it ,\" said the landlord , \" and i told him he couldn \\' t sell it here , the market \\' s overstocked .\" \" with what ?\" shouted i . \" with heads to be sure ; ain \\' t there too many heads in the world ?\" \" i tell you what it is , landlord ,\" said i quite calmly , \" you \\' d better stop spinning that yarn to me -- i \\' m not green .\" \" may be not ,\" taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick , \" but i rayther guess you \\' ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin \\' his head .\" \" i \\' ll break it for him ,\" said i , now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord \\' s . \" it \\' s broke a \\' ready ,\" said he . \" broke ,\" said i --\" broke , do you mean ?\" \" sartain , and that \\' s the very reason he can \\' t sell it , i guess .\" \" landlord ,\" said i , going up to him as cool as mt . hecla in a snow - storm --\" landlord , stop whittling . you and i must understand one another , and that too without delay . i come to your house and want a bed ; you tell me you can only give me half a one ; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer . and about this harpooneer , whom i have not yet seen , you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow -- a sort of connexion , landlord , which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree . i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is , and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him . and in the first place , you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head , which if true i take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad , and i \\' ve no idea of sleeping with a madman ; and you , sir , you i mean , landlord , you , sir , by trying to induce me to do so knowingly , would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution .\" \" wall ,\" said the landlord , fetching a long breath , \" that \\' s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then . but be easy , be easy , this here harpooneer i have been tellin \\' you of has just arrived from the south seas , where he bought up a lot of \\' balmed new zealand heads ( great curios , you know ), and he \\' s sold all on \\' em but one , and that one he \\' s trying to sell to - night , cause to - morrow \\' s sunday , and it would not do to be sellin \\' human heads about the streets when folks is goin \\' to churches . he wanted to , last sunday , but i stopped him just as he was goin \\' out of the door with four heads strung on a string , for all the airth like a string of inions .\" this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery , and showed that the landlord , after all , had had no idea of fooling me -- but at the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath , engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators ? \" depend upon it , landlord , that harpooneer is a dangerous man .\" \" he pays reg \\' lar ,\" was the rejoinder . \" but come , it \\' s getting dreadful late , you had better be turning flukes -- it \\' s a nice bed ; sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced . there \\' s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed ; it \\' s an almighty big bed that . why , afore we give it up , sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it . but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night , and somehow , sam got pitched on the floor , and came near breaking his arm . arter that , sal said it wouldn \\' t do . come along here , i \\' ll give ye a glim in a jiffy ;\" and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me , offering to lead the way . but i stood irresolute ; when looking at a clock in the corner , he exclaimed \" i vum it \\' s sunday -- you won \\' t see that harpooneer to - night ; he \\' s come to anchor somewhere -- come along then ; do come ; won \\' t ye come ?\" i considered the matter a moment , and then up stairs we went , and i was ushered into a small room , cold as a clam , and furnished , sure enough , with a prodigious bed , almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast . \" there ,\" said the landlord , placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash - stand and centre table ; \" there , make yourself comfortable now , and good night to ye .\" i turned round from eyeing the bed , but he had disappeared . folding back the counterpane , i stooped over the bed . though none of the most elegant , it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well . i then glanced round the room ; and besides the bedstead and centre table , could see no other furniture belonging to the place , but a rude shelf , the four walls , and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale . of things not properly belonging to the room , there was a hammock lashed up , and thrown upon the floor in one corner ; also a large seaman \\' s bag , containing the harpooneer \\' s wardrobe , no doubt in lieu of a land trunk . likewise , there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire - place , and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed . but what is this on the chest ? i took it up , and held it close to the light , and felt it , and smelt it , and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it . i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat , ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an indian moccasin . there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat , as you see the same in south american ponchos . but could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat , and parade the streets of any christian town in that sort of guise ? i put it on , to try it , and it weighed me down like a hamper , being uncommonly shaggy and thick , and i thought a little damp , as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day . i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall , and i never saw such a sight in my life . i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck . i sat down on the side of the bed , and commenced thinking about this head - peddling harpooneer , and his door mat . after thinking some time on the bed - side , i got up and took off my monkey jacket , and then stood in the middle of the room thinking . i then took off my coat , and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves . but beginning to feel very cold now , half undressed as i was , and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer \\' s not coming home at all that night , it being so very late , i made no more ado , but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots , and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed , and commended myself to the care of heaven . whether that mattress was stuffed with corn - cobs or broken crockery , there is no telling , but i rolled about a good deal , and could not sleep for a long time . at last i slid off into a light doze , and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod , when i heard a heavy footfall in the passage , and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door . lord save me , thinks i , that must be the harpooneer , the infernal head - peddler . but i lay perfectly still , and resolved not to say a word till spoken to . holding a light in one hand , and that identical new zealand head in the other , the stranger entered the room , and without looking towards the bed , placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner , and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room . i was all eagerness to see his face , but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag \\' s mouth . this accomplished , however , he turned round -- when , good heavens ! what a sight ! such a face ! it was of a dark , purplish , yellow colour , here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares . yes , it \\' s just as i thought , he \\' s a terrible bedfellow ; he \\' s been in a fight , got dreadfully cut , and here he is , just from the surgeon . but at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light , that i plainly saw they could not be sticking - plasters at all , those black squares on his cheeks . they were stains of some sort or other . at first i knew not what to make of this ; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me . i remembered a story of a white man -- a whaleman too -- who , falling among the cannibals , had been tattooed by them . i concluded that this harpooneer , in the course of his distant voyages , must have met with a similar adventure . and what is it , thought i , after all ! it \\' s only his outside ; a man can be honest in any sort of skin . but then , what to make of his unearthly complexion , that part of it , i mean , lying round about , and completely independent of the squares of tattooing . to be sure , it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning ; but i never heard of a hot sun \\' s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one . however , i had never been in the south seas ; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin . now , while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning , this harpooneer never noticed me at all . but , after some difficulty having opened his bag , he commenced fumbling in it , and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk , and a seal - skin wallet with the hair on . placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room , he then took the new zealand head -- a ghastly thing enough -- and crammed it down into the bag . he now took off his hat -- a new beaver hat -- when i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise . there was no hair on his head -- none to speak of at least -- nothing but a small scalp - knot twisted up on his forehead . his bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull . had not the stranger stood between me and the door , i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner . even as it was , i thought something of slipping out of the window , but it was the second floor back . i am no coward , but what to make of this head - peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension . ignorance is the parent of fear , and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger , i confess i was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night . in fact , i was so afraid of him that i was not game enough just then to address him , and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him . meanwhile , he continued the business of undressing , and at last showed his chest and arms . as i live , these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face ; his back , too , was all over the same dark squares ; he seemed to have been in a thirty years \\' war , and just escaped from it with a sticking - plaster shirt . still more , his very legs were marked , as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms . it was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south seas , and so landed in this christian country . i quaked to think of it . a peddler of heads too -- perhaps the heads of his own brothers . he might take a fancy to mine -- heavens ! look at that tomahawk ! but there was no time for shuddering , for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention , and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen . going to his heavy grego , or wrapall , or dreadnaught , which he had previously hung on a chair , he fumbled in the pockets , and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back , and exactly the colour of a three days \\' old congo baby . remembering the embalmed head , at first i almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner . but seeing that it was not at all limber , and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony , i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol , which indeed it proved to be . for now the savage goes up to the empty fire - place , and removing the papered fire - board , sets up this little hunch - backed image , like a tenpin , between the andirons . the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty , so that i thought this fire - place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol . i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image , feeling but ill at ease meantime -- to see what was next to follow . first he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket , and places them carefully before the idol ; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp , he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze . presently , after many hasty snatches into the fire , and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers ( whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly ), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit ; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little , he made a polite offer of it to the little negro . but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all ; he never moved his lips . all these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee , who seemed to be praying in a sing - song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other , during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner . at last extinguishing the fire , he took the idol up very unceremoniously , and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock . all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness , and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations , and jumping into bed with me , i thought it was high time , now or never , before the light was put out , to break the spell in which i had so long been bound . but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say , was a fatal one . taking up his tomahawk from the table , he examined the head of it for an instant , and then holding it to the light , with his mouth at the handle , he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke . the next moment the light was extinguished , and this wild cannibal , tomahawk between his teeth , sprang into bed with me . i sang out , i could not help it now ; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me . stammering out something , i knew not what , i rolled away from him against the wall , and then conjured him , whoever or whatever he might be , to keep quiet , and let me get up and light the lamp again . but his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning . \" who - e debel you ?\"-- he at last said --\" you no speak - e , dam - me , i kill - e .\" and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark . \" landlord , for god \\' s sake , peter coffin !\" shouted i . \" landlord ! watch ! coffin ! angels ! save me !\" \" speak - e ! tell - ee me who - ee be , or dam - me , i kill - e !\" again growled the cannibal , while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire . but thank heaven , at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand , and leaping from the bed i ran up to him . \" don \\' t be afraid now ,\" said he , grinning again , \" queequeg here wouldn \\' t harm a hair of your head .\" \" stop your grinning ,\" shouted i , \" and why didn \\' t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal ?\" \" i thought ye know \\' d it ;-- didn \\' t i tell ye , he was a peddlin \\' heads around town ?-- but turn flukes again and go to sleep . queequeg , look here -- you sabbee me , i sabbee -- you this man sleepe you -- you sabbee ?\" \" me sabbee plenty \"-- grunted queequeg , puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed . \" you gettee in ,\" he added , motioning to me with his tomahawk , and throwing the clothes to one side . he really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way . i stood looking at him a moment . for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean , comely looking cannibal . what \\' s all this fuss i have been making about , thought i to myself -- the man \\' s a human being just as i am : he has just as much reason to fear me , as i have to be afraid of him . better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian . \" landlord ,\" said i , \" tell him to stash his tomahawk there , or pipe , or whatever you call it ; tell him to stop smoking , in short , and i will turn in with him . but i don \\' t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me . it \\' s dangerous . besides , i ain \\' t insured .\" this being told to queequeg , he at once complied , and again politely motioned me to get into bed -- rolling over to one side as much as to say -- i won \\' t touch a leg of ye .\" \" good night , landlord ,\" said i , \" you may go .\" i turned in , and never slept better in my life . chapter 4 the counterpane . upon waking next morning about daylight , i found queequeg \\' s arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner . you had almost thought i had been his wife . the counterpane was of patchwork , full of odd little parti - coloured squares and triangles ; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure , no two parts of which were of one precise shade -- owing i suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade , his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times -- this same arm of his , i say , looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt . indeed , partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke , i could hardly tell it from the quilt , they so blended their hues together ; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that queequeg was hugging me . my sensations were strange . let me try to explain them . when i was a child , i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me ; whether it was a reality or a dream , i never could entirely settle . the circumstance was this . i had been cutting up some caper or other -- i think it was trying to crawl up the chimney , as i had seen a little sweep do a few days previous ; and my stepmother who , somehow or other , was all the time whipping me , or sending me to bed supperless ,-- my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed , though it was only two o \\' clock in the afternoon of the 21st june , the longest day in the year in our hemisphere . i felt dreadfully . but there was no help for it , so up stairs i went to my little room in the third floor , undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time , and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets . i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before i could hope for a resurrection . sixteen hours in bed ! the small of my back ached to think of it . and it was so light too ; the sun shining in at the window , and a great rattling of coaches in the streets , and the sound of gay voices all over the house . i felt worse and worse -- at last i got up , dressed , and softly going down in my stockinged feet , sought out my stepmother , and suddenly threw myself at her feet , beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour ; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time . but she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers , and back i had to go to my room . for several hours i lay there broad awake , feeling a great deal worse than i have ever done since , even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes . at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze ; and slowly waking from it -- half steeped in dreams -- i opened my eyes , and the before sun - lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness . instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame ; nothing was to be seen , and nothing was to be heard ; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine . my arm hung over the counterpane , and the nameless , unimaginable , silent form or phantom , to which the hand belonged , seemed closely seated by my bed - side . for what seemed ages piled on ages , i lay there , frozen with the most awful fears , not daring to drag away my hand ; yet ever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch , the horrid spell would be broken . i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me ; but waking in the morning , i shudderingly remembered it all , and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery . nay , to this very hour , i often puzzle myself with it . now , take away the awful fear , and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar , in their strangeness , to those which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequeg \\' s pagan arm thrown round me . but at length all the past night \\' s events soberly recurred , one by one , in fixed reality , and then i lay only alive to the comical predicament . for though i tried to move his arm -- unlock his bridegroom clasp -- yet , sleeping as he was , he still hugged me tightly , as though naught but death should part us twain . i now strove to rouse him --\" queequeg !\"-- but his only answer was a snore . i then rolled over , my neck feeling as if it were in a horse - collar ; and suddenly felt a slight scratch . throwing aside the counterpane , there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage \\' s side , as if it were a hatchet - faced baby . a pretty pickle , truly , thought i ; abed here in a strange house in the broad day , with a cannibal and a tomahawk ! \" queequeg !-- in the name of goodness , queequeg , wake !\" at length , by dint of much wriggling , and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style , i succeeded in extracting a grunt ; and presently , he drew back his arm , shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water , and sat up in bed , stiff as a pike - staff , looking at me , and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there , though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him . meanwhile , i lay quietly eyeing him , having no serious misgivings now , and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature . when , at last , his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow , and he became , as it were , reconciled to the fact ; he jumped out upon the floor , and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that , if it pleased me , he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards , leaving the whole apartment to myself . thinks i , queequeg , under the circumstances , this is a very civilized overture ; but , the truth is , these savages have an innate sense of delicacy , say what you will ; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are . i pay this particular compliment to queequeg , because he treated me with so much civility and consideration , while i was guilty of great rudeness ; staring at him from the bed , and watching all his toilette motions ; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding . nevertheless , a man like queequeg you don \\' t see every day , he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding . he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat , a very tall one , by the by , and then -- still minus his trowsers -- he hunted up his boots . what under the heavens he did it for , i cannot tell , but his next movement was to crush himself -- boots in hand , and hat on -- under the bed ; when , from sundry violent gaspings and strainings , i inferred he was hard at work booting himself ; though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of , is any man required to be private when putting on his boots . but queequeg , do you see , was a creature in the transition stage -- neither caterpillar nor butterfly . he was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners . his education was not yet completed . he was an undergraduate . if he had not been a small degree civilized , he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all ; but then , if he had not been still a savage , he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on . at last , he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes , and began creaking and limping about the room , as if , not being much accustomed to boots , his pair of damp , wrinkled cowhide ones -- probably not made to order either -- rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning . seeing , now , that there were no curtains to the window , and that the street being very narrow , the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room , and observing more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg made , staving about with little else but his hat and boots on ; i begged him as well as i could , to accelerate his toilet somewhat , and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible . he complied , and then proceeded to wash himself . at that time in the morning any christian would have washed his face ; but queequeg , to my amazement , contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest , arms , and hands . he then donned his waistcoat , and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash - stand centre table , dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face . i was watching to see where he kept his razor , when lo and behold , he takes the harpoon from the bed corner , slips out the long wooden stock , unsheathes the head , whets it a little on his boot , and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall , begins a vigorous scraping , or rather harpooning of his cheeks . thinks i , queequeg , this is using rogers \\' s best cutlery with a vengeance . afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made , and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept . the rest of his toilet was soon achieved , and he proudly marched out of the room , wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket , and sporting his harpoon like a marshal \\' s baton . chapter 5 breakfast . i quickly followed suit , and descending into the bar - room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly . i cherished no malice towards him , though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow . however , a good laugh is a mighty good thing , and rather too scarce a good thing ; the more \\' s the pity . so , if any one man , in his own proper person , afford stuff for a good joke to anybody , let him not be backward , but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way . and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him , be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for . the bar - room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous , and whom i had not as yet had a good look at . they were nearly all whalemen ; chief mates , and second mates , and third mates , and sea carpenters , and sea coopers , and sea blacksmiths , and harpooneers , and ship keepers ; a brown and brawny company , with bosky beards ; an unshorn , shaggy set , all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns . you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore . this young fellow \\' s healthy cheek is like a sun - toasted pear in hue , and would seem to smell almost as musky ; he cannot have been three days landed from his indian voyage . that man next him looks a few shades lighter ; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him . in the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn , but slightly bleached withal ; he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore . but who could show a cheek like queequeg ? which , barred with various tints , seemed like the andes \\' western slope , to show forth in one array , contrasting climates , zone by zone . \" grub , ho !\" now cried the landlord , flinging open a door , and in we went to breakfast . they say that men who have seen the world , thereby become quite at ease in manner , quite self - possessed in company . not always , though : ledyard , the great new england traveller , and mungo park , the scotch one ; of all men , they possessed the least assurance in the parlor . but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as ledyard did , or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach , in the negro heart of africa , which was the sum of poor mungo \\' s performances -- this kind of travel , i say , may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish . still , for the most part , that sort of thing is to be had anywhere . these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table , and i was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling ; to my no small surprise , nearly every man maintained a profound silence . and not only that , but they looked embarrassed . yes , here were a set of sea - dogs , many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas -- entire strangers to them -- and duelled them dead without winking ; and yet , here they sat at a social breakfast table -- all of the same calling , all of kindred tastes -- looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains . a curious sight ; these bashful bears , these timid warrior whalemen ! but as for queequeg -- why , queequeg sat there among them -- at the head of the table , too , it so chanced ; as cool as an icicle . to be sure i cannot say much for his breeding . his greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him , and using it there without ceremony ; reaching over the table with it , to the imminent jeopardy of many heads , and grappling the beefsteaks towards him . but that was certainly very coolly done by him , and every one knows that in most people \\' s estimation , to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly . we will not speak of all queequeg \\' s peculiarities here ; how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls , and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks , done rare . enough , that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room , lighted his tomahawk - pipe , and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on , when i sallied out for a stroll . chapter 6 the street . if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town , that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of new bedford . in thoroughfares nigh the docks , any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts . even in broadway and chestnut streets , mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies . regent street is not unknown to lascars and malays ; and at bombay , in the apollo green , live yankees have often scared the natives . but new bedford beats all water street and wapping . in these last - mentioned haunts you see only sailors ; but in new bedford , actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners ; savages outright ; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh . it makes a stranger stare . but , besides the feegeeans , tongatobooarrs , erromanggoans , pannangians , and brighggians , and , besides the wild specimens of the whaling - craft which unheeded reel about the streets , you will see other sights still more curious , certainly more comical . there weekly arrive in this town scores of green vermonters and new hampshire men , all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery . they are mostly young , of stalwart frames ; fellows who have felled forests , and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale - lance . many are as green as the green mountains whence they came . in some things you would think them but a few hours old . look there ! that chap strutting round the corner . he wears a beaver hat and swallow - tailed coat , girdled with a sailor - belt and sheath - knife . here comes another with a sou \\'- wester and a bombazine cloak . no town - bred dandy will compare with a country - bred one -- i mean a downright bumpkin dandy -- a fellow that , in the dog - days , will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands . now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation , and joins the great whale - fishery , you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport . in bespeaking his sea - outfit , he orders bell - buttons to his waistcoats ; straps to his canvas trowsers . ah , poor hay - seed ! how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale , when thou art driven , straps , buttons , and all , down the throat of the tempest . but think not that this famous town has only harpooneers , cannibals , and bumpkins to show her visitors . not at all . still new bedford is a queer place . had it not been for us whalemen , that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of labrador . as it is , parts of her back country are enough to frighten one , they look so bony . the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in , in all new england . it is a land of oil , true enough : but not like canaan ; a land , also , of corn and wine . the streets do not run with milk ; nor in the spring - time do they pave them with fresh eggs . yet , in spite of this , nowhere in all america will you find more patrician - like houses ; parks and gardens more opulent , than in new bedford . whence came they ? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country ? go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion , and your question will be answered . yes ; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the atlantic , pacific , and indian oceans . one and all , they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea . can herr alexander perform a feat like that ? in new bedford , fathers , they say , give whales for dowers to their daughters , and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a - piece . you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding ; for , they say , they have reservoirs of oil in every house , and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles . in summer time , the town is sweet to see ; full of fine maples -- long avenues of green and gold . and in august , high in air , the beautiful and bountiful horse - chestnuts , candelabra - wise , proffer the passer - by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms . so omnipotent is art ; which in many a district of new bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation \\' s final day . and the women of new bedford , they bloom like their own red roses . but roses only bloom in summer ; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens . elsewhere match that bloom of theirs , ye cannot , save in salem , where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk , their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore , as though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of the puritanic sands . chapter 7 the chapel . in this same new bedford there stands a whaleman \\' s chapel , and few are the moody fishermen , shortly bound for the indian ocean or pacific , who fail to make a sunday visit to the spot . i am sure that i did not . returning from my first morning stroll , i again sallied out upon this special errand . the sky had changed from clear , sunny cold , to driving sleet and mist . wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin , i fought my way against the stubborn storm . entering , i found a small scattered congregation of sailors , and sailors \\' wives and widows . a muffled silence reigned , only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm . each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other , as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable . the chaplain had not yet arrived ; and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets , with black borders , masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit . three of them ran something like the following , but i do not pretend to quote :-- sacred to the memory of john talbot , who , at the age of eighteen , was lost overboard , near the isle of desolation , off patagonia , november 1st , 1836 . this tablet is erected to his memory by his sister . _____________ sacred to the memory of robert long , willis ellery , nathan coleman , walter canny , seth macy , and samuel gleig , forming one of the boats \\' crews of the ship eliza who were towed out of sight by a whale , on the off - shore ground in the pacific , december 31st , 1839 . this marble is here placed by their surviving shipmates . _____________ sacred to the memory of the late captain ezekiel hardy , who in the bows of his boat was killed by a sperm whale on the coast of japan , august 3d , 1833 . this tablet is erected to his memory by his widow . shaking off the sleet from my ice - glazed hat and jacket , i seated myself near the door , and turning sideways was surprised to see queequeg near me . affected by the solemnity of the scene , there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance . this savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance ; because he was the only one who could not read , and , therefore , was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall . whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation , i knew not ; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery , and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief , that i feel sure that here before me were assembled those , in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh . oh ! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass ; who standing among flowers can say -- here , here lies my beloved ; ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these . what bitter blanks in those black - bordered marbles which cover no ashes ! what despair in those immovable inscriptions ! what deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith , and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave . as well might those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here . in what census of living creatures , the dead of mankind are included ; why it is that a universal proverb says of them , that they tell no tales , though containing more secrets than the goodwin sands ; how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world , we prefix so significant and infidel a word , and yet do not thus entitle him , if he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth ; why the life insurance companies pay death - forfeitures upon immortals ; in what eternal , unstirring paralysis , and deadly , hopeless trance , yet lies antique adam who died sixty round centuries ago ; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss ; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead ; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city . all these things are not without their meanings . but faith , like a jackal , feeds among the tombs , and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope . it needs scarcely to be told , with what feelings , on the eve of a nantucket voyage , i regarded those marble tablets , and by the murky light of that darkened , doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me . yes , ishmael , the same fate may be thine . but somehow i grew merry again . delightful inducements to embark , fine chance for promotion , it seems -- aye , a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet . yes , there is death in this business of whaling -- a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity . but what then ? methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death . methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance . methinks that in looking at things spiritual , we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water , and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air . methinks my body is but the lees of my better being . in fact take my body who will , take it i say , it is not me . and therefore three cheers for nantucket ; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will , for stave my soul , jove himself cannot . chapter 8 the pulpit . i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered ; immediately as the storm - pelted door flew back upon admitting him , a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation , sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain . yes , it was the famous father mapple , so called by the whalemen , among whom he was a very great favourite . he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth , but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry . at the time i now write of , father mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age ; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth , for among all the fissures of his wrinkles , there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom -- the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath february \\' s snow . no one having previously heard his history , could for the first time behold father mapple without the utmost interest , because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him , imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led . when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella , and certainly had not come in his carriage , for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet , and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed . however , hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed , and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner ; when , arrayed in a decent suit , he quietly approached the pulpit . like most old fashioned pulpits , it was a very lofty one , and since a regular stairs to such a height would , by its long angle with the floor , seriously contract the already small area of the chapel , the architect , it seemed , had acted upon the hint of father mapple , and finished the pulpit without a stairs , substituting a perpendicular side ladder , like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea . the wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man - ropes for this ladder , which , being itself nicely headed , and stained with a mahogany colour , the whole contrivance , considering what manner of chapel it was , seemed by no means in bad taste . halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder , and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man - ropes , father mapple cast a look upwards , and then with a truly sailor - like but still reverential dexterity , hand over hand , mounted the steps as if ascending the main - top of his vessel . the perpendicular parts of this side ladder , as is usually the case with swinging ones , were of cloth - covered rope , only the rounds were of wood , so that at every step there was a joint . at my first glimpse of the pulpit , it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship , these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary . for i was not prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height , slowly turn round , and stooping over the pulpit , deliberately drag up the ladder step by step , till the whole was deposited within , leaving him impregnable in his little quebec . i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this . father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity , that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage . no , thought i , there must be some sober reason for this thing ; furthermore , it must symbolize something unseen . can it be , then , that by that act of physical isolation , he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time , from all outward worldly ties and connexions ? yes , for replenished with the meat and wine of the word , to the faithful man of god , this pulpit , i see , is a self - containing stronghold -- a lofty ehrenbreitstein , with a perennial well of water within the walls . but the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place , borrowed from the chaplain \\' s former sea - farings . between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit , the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers . but high above the flying scud and dark - rolling clouds , there floated a little isle of sunlight , from which beamed forth an angel \\' s face ; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship \\' s tossed deck , something like that silver plate now inserted into the victory \\' s plank where nelson fell . \" ah , noble ship ,\" the angel seemed to say , \" beat on , beat on , thou noble ship , and bear a hardy helm ; for lo ! the sun is breaking through ; the clouds are rolling off -- serenest azure is at hand .\" nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea - taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture . its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship \\' s bluff bows , and the holy bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work , fashioned after a ship \\' s fiddle - headed beak . what could be more full of meaning ?-- for the pulpit is ever this earth \\' s foremost part ; all the rest comes in its rear ; the pulpit leads the world . from thence it is the storm of god \\' s quick wrath is first descried , and the bow must bear the earliest brunt . from thence it is the god of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds . yes , the world \\' s a ship on its passage out , and not a voyage complete ; and the pulpit is its prow . chapter 9 the sermon . father mapple rose , and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense . \" starboard gangway , there ! side away to larboard -- larboard gangway to starboard ! midships ! midships !\" there was a low rumbling of heavy sea - boots among the benches , and a still slighter shuffling of women \\' s shoes , and all was quiet again , and every eye on the preacher . he paused a little ; then kneeling in the pulpit \\' s bows , folded his large brown hands across his chest , uplifted his closed eyes , and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea . this ended , in prolonged solemn tones , like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog -- in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn ; but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas , burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy -- \" the ribs and terrors in the whale , arched over me a dismal gloom , while all god \\' s sun - lit waves rolled by , and lift me deepening down to doom . \" i saw the opening maw of hell , with endless pains and sorrows there ; which none but they that feel can tell -- oh , i was plunging to despair . \" in black distress , i called my god , when i could scarce believe him mine , he bowed his ear to my complaints -- no more the whale did me confine . \" with speed he flew to my relief , as on a radiant dolphin borne ; awful , yet bright , as lightning shone the face of my deliverer god . \" my song for ever shall record that terrible , that joyful hour ; i give the glory to my god , his all the mercy and the power . nearly all joined in singing this hymn , which swelled high above the howling of the storm . a brief pause ensued ; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the bible , and at last , folding his hand down upon the proper page , said : \" beloved shipmates , clinch the last verse of the first chapter of jonah --\\' and god had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah .\\'\" \" shipmates , this book , containing only four chapters -- four yarns -- is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures . yet what depths of the soul does jonah \\' s deep sealine sound ! what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet ! what a noble thing is that canticle in the fish \\' s belly ! how billow - like and boisterously grand ! we feel the floods surging over us ; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters ; sea - weed and all the slime of the sea is about us ! but what is this lesson that the book of jonah teaches ? shipmates , it is a two - stranded lesson ; a lesson to us all as sinful men , and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living god . as sinful men , it is a lesson to us all , because it is a story of the sin , hard - heartedness , suddenly awakened fears , the swift punishment , repentance , prayers , and finally the deliverance and joy of jonah . as with all sinners among men , the sin of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of god -- never mind now what that command was , or how conveyed -- which he found a hard command . but all the things that god would have us do are hard for us to do -- remember that -- and hence , he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade . and if we obey god , we must disobey ourselves ; and it is in this disobeying ourselves , wherein the hardness of obeying god consists . \" with this sin of disobedience in him , jonah still further flouts at god , by seeking to flee from him . he thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where god does not reign , but only the captains of this earth . he skulks about the wharves of joppa , and seeks a ship that \\' s bound for tarshish . there lurks , perhaps , a hitherto unheeded meaning here . by all accounts tarshish could have been no other city than the modern cadiz . that \\' s the opinion of learned men . and where is cadiz , shipmates ? cadiz is in spain ; as far by water , from joppa , as jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days , when the atlantic was an almost unknown sea . because joppa , the modern jaffa , shipmates , is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean , the syrian ; and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that , just outside the straits of gibraltar . see ye not then , shipmates , that jonah sought to flee world - wide from god ? miserable man ! oh ! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn ; with slouched hat and guilty eye , skulking from his god ; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas . so disordered , self - condemning is his look , that had there been policemen in those days , jonah , on the mere suspicion of something wrong , had been arrested ere he touched a deck . how plainly he \\' s a fugitive ! no baggage , not a hat - box , valise , or carpet - bag ,-- no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux . at last , after much dodging search , he finds the tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo ; and as he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin , all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods , to mark the stranger \\' s evil eye . jonah sees this ; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence ; in vain essays his wretched smile . strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent . in their gamesome but still serious way , one whispers to the other --\" jack , he \\' s robbed a widow ;\" or , \" joe , do you mark him ; he \\' s a bigamist ;\" or , \" harry lad , i guess he \\' s the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah , or belike , one of the missing murderers from sodom .\" another runs to read the bill that \\' s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored , offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide , and containing a description of his person . he reads , and looks from jonah to the bill ; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round jonah , prepared to lay their hands upon him . frighted jonah trembles , and summoning all his boldness to his face , only looks so much the more a coward . he will not confess himself suspected ; but that itself is strong suspicion . so he makes the best of it ; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised , they let him pass , and he descends into the cabin . \"\\' who \\' s there ?\\' cries the captain at his busy desk , hurriedly making out his papers for the customs --\\' who \\' s there ?\\' oh ! how that harmless question mangles jonah ! for the instant he almost turns to flee again . but he rallies . \\' i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish ; how soon sail ye , sir ?\\' thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah , though the man now stands before him ; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice , than he darts a scrutinizing glance . \\' we sail with the next coming tide ,\\' at last he slowly answered , still intently eyeing him . \\' no sooner , sir ?\\'--\\' soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger .\\' ha ! jonah , that \\' s another stab . but he swiftly calls away the captain from that scent . \\' i \\' ll sail with ye ,\\'-- he says ,--\\' the passage money how much is that ?-- i \\' ll pay now .\\' for it is particularly written , shipmates , as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history , \\' that he paid the fare thereof \\' ere the craft did sail . and taken with the context , this is full of meaning . \" now jonah \\' s captain , shipmates , was one whose discernment detects crime in any , but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless . in this world , shipmates , sin that pays its way can travel freely , and without a passport ; whereas virtue , if a pauper , is stopped at all frontiers . so jonah \\' s captain prepares to test the length of jonah \\' s purse , ere he judge him openly . he charges him thrice the usual sum ; and it \\' s assented to . then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive ; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold . yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse , prudent suspicions still molest the captain . he rings every coin to find a counterfeit . not a forger , any way , he mutters ; and jonah is put down for his passage . \\' point out my state - room , sir ,\\' says jonah now , \\' i \\' m travel - weary ; i need sleep .\\' \\' thou lookest like it ,\\' says the captain , \\' there \\' s thy room .\\' jonah enters , and would lock the door , but the lock contains no key . hearing him foolishly fumbling there , the captain laughs lowly to himself , and mutters something about the doors of convicts \\' cells being never allowed to be locked within . all dressed and dusty as he is , jonah throws himself into his berth , and finds the little state - room ceiling almost resting on his forehead . the air is close , and jonah gasps . then , in that contracted hole , sunk , too , beneath the ship \\' s water - line , jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour , when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels \\' wards . \" screwed at its axis against the side , a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in jonah \\' s room ; and the ship , heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received , the lamp , flame and all , though in slight motion , still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room ; though , in truth , infallibly straight itself , it but made obvious the false , lying levels among which it hung . the lamp alarms and frightens jonah ; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place , and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance . but that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him . the floor , the ceiling , and the side , are all awry . \\' oh ! so my conscience hangs in me !\\' he groans , \\' straight upwards , so it burns ; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness !\\' \" like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed , still reeling , but with conscience yet pricking him , as the plungings of the roman race - horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him ; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish , praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed ; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels , a deep stupor steals over him , as over the man who bleeds to death , for conscience is the wound , and there \\' s naught to staunch it ; so , after sore wrestlings in his berth , jonah \\' s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep . \" and now the time of tide has come ; the ship casts off her cables ; and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish , all careening , glides to sea . that ship , my friends , was the first of recorded smugglers ! the contraband was jonah . but the sea rebels ; he will not bear the wicked burden . a dreadful storm comes on , the ship is like to break . but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her ; when boxes , bales , and jars are clattering overboard ; when the wind is shrieking , and the men are yelling , and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over jonah \\' s head ; in all this raging tumult , jonah sleeps his hideous sleep . he sees no black sky and raging sea , feels not the reeling timbers , and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale , which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him . aye , shipmates , jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship -- a berth in the cabin as i have taken it , and was fast asleep . but the frightened master comes to him , and shrieks in his dead ear , \\' what meanest thou , o , sleeper ! arise !\\' startled from his lethargy by that direful cry , jonah staggers to his feet , and stumbling to the deck , grasps a shroud , to look out upon the sea . but at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks . wave after wave thus leaps into the ship , and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft , till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat . and ever , as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead , aghast jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward , but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep . \" terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul . in all his cringing attitudes , the god - fugitive is now too plainly known . the sailors mark him ; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him , and at last , fully to test the truth , by referring the whole matter to high heaven , they fall to casting lots , to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them . the lot is jonah \\' s ; that discovered , then how furiously they mob him with their questions . \\' what is thine occupation ? whence comest thou ? thy country ? what people ? but mark now , my shipmates , the behavior of poor jonah . the eager mariners but ask him who he is , and where from ; whereas , they not only receive an answer to those questions , but likewise another answer to a question not put by them , but the unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is upon him . \"\\' i am a hebrew ,\\' he cries -- and then --\\' i fear the lord the god of heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land !\\' fear him , o jonah ? aye , well mightest thou fear the lord god then ! straightway , he now goes on to make a full confession ; whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled , but still are pitiful . for when jonah , not yet supplicating god for mercy , since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts ,-- when wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea , for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them ; they mercifully turn from him , and seek by other means to save the ship . but all in vain ; the indignant gale howls louder ; then , with one hand raised invokingly to god , with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of jonah . \" and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea ; when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east , and the sea is still , as jonah carries down the gale with him , leaving smooth water behind . he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him ; and the whale shoots - to all his ivory teeth , like so many white bolts , upon his prison . then jonah prayed unto the lord out of the fish \\' s belly . but observe his prayer , and learn a weighty lesson . for sinful as he is , jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance . he feels that his dreadful punishment is just . he leaves all his deliverance to god , contenting himself with this , that spite of all his pains and pangs , he will still look towards his holy temple . and here , shipmates , is true and faithful repentance ; not clamorous for pardon , but grateful for punishment . and how pleasing to god was this conduct in jonah , is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale . shipmates , i do not place jonah before you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as a model for repentance . sin not ; but if you do , take heed to repent of it like jonah .\" while he was speaking these words , the howling of the shrieking , slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher , who , when describing jonah \\' s sea - storm , seemed tossed by a storm himself . his deep chest heaved as with a ground - swell ; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work ; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow , and the light leaping from his eye , made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them . there now came a lull in his look , as he silently turned over the leaves of the book once more ; and , at last , standing motionless , with closed eyes , for the moment , seemed communing with god and himself . but again he leaned over towards the people , and bowing his head lowly , with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility , he spake these words : \" shipmates , god has laid but one hand upon you ; both his hands press upon me . i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that jonah teaches to all sinners ; and therefore to ye , and still more to me , for i am a greater sinner than ye . and now how gladly would i come down from this mast - head and sit on the hatches there where you sit , and listen as you listen , while some one of you reads me that other and more awful lesson which jonah teaches to me , as a pilot of the living god . how being an anointed pilot - prophet , or speaker of true things , and bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked nineveh , jonah , appalled at the hostility he should raise , fled from his mission , and sought to escape his duty and his god by taking ship at joppa . but god is everywhere ; tarshish he never reached . as we have seen , god came upon him in the whale , and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom , and with swift slantings tore him along \\' into the midst of the seas ,\\' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down , and \\' the weeds were wrapped about his head ,\\' and all the watery world of woe bowled over him . yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet --\\' out of the belly of hell \\'-- when the whale grounded upon the ocean \\' s utmost bones , even then , god heard the engulphed , repenting prophet when he cried . then god spake unto the fish ; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea , the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun , and all the delights of air and earth ; and \\' vomited out jonah upon the dry land ;\\' when the word of the lord came a second time ; and jonah , bruised and beaten -- his ears , like two sea - shells , still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean -- jonah did the almighty \\' s bidding . and what was that , shipmates ? to preach the truth to the face of falsehood ! that was it ! \" this , shipmates , this is that other lesson ; and woe to that pilot of the living god who slights it . woe to him whom this world charms from gospel duty ! woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when god has brewed them into a gale ! woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal ! woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness ! woe to him who , in this world , courts not dishonour ! woe to him who would not be true , even though to be false were salvation ! yea , woe to him who , as the great pilot paul has it , while preaching to others is himself a castaway !\" he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment ; then lifting his face to them again , showed a deep joy in his eyes , as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm ,--\" but oh ! shipmates ! on the starboard hand of every woe , there is a sure delight ; and higher the top of that delight , than the bottom of the woe is deep . is not the main - truck higher than the kelson is low ? delight is to him -- a far , far upward , and inward delight -- who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth , ever stands forth his own inexorable self . delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him , when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him . delight is to him , who gives no quarter in the truth , and kills , burns , and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of senators and judges . delight ,-- top - gallant delight is to him , who acknowledges no law or lord , but the lord his god , and is only a patriot to heaven . delight is to him , whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keel of the ages . and eternal delight and deliciousness will be his , who coming to lay him down , can say with his final breath -- o father !-- chiefly known to me by thy rod -- mortal or immortal , here i die . i have striven to be thine , more than to be this world \\' s , or mine own . yet this is nothing : i leave eternity to thee ; for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his god ?\" he said no more , but slowly waving a benediction , covered his face with his hands , and so remained kneeling , till all the people had departed , and he was left alone in the place . chapter 10 a bosom friend . returning to the spouter - inn from the chapel , i found queequeg there quite alone ; he having left the chapel before the benediction some time . he was sitting on a bench before the fire , with his feet on the stove hearth , and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his ; peering hard into its face , and with a jack - knife gently whittling away at its nose , meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way . but being now interrupted , he put up the image ; and pretty soon , going to the table , took up a large book there , and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity ; at every fiftieth page -- as i fancied -- stopping a moment , looking vacantly around him , and giving utterance to a long - drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment . he would then begin again at the next fifty ; seeming to commence at number one each time , as though he could not count more than fifty , and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together , that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited . with much interest i sat watching him . savage though he was , and hideously marred about the face -- at least to my taste -- his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable . you cannot hide the soul . through all his unearthly tattooings , i thought i saw the traces of a simple honest heart ; and in his large , deep eyes , fiery black and bold , there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils . and besides all this , there was a certain lofty bearing about the pagan , which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim . he looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor . whether it was , too , that his head being shaved , his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief , and looked more expansive than it otherwise would , this i will not venture to decide ; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one . it may seem ridiculous , but it reminded me of general washington \\' s head , as seen in the popular busts of him . it had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows , which were likewise very projecting , like two long promontories thickly wooded on top . queequeg was george washington cannibalistically developed . whilst i was thus closely scanning him , half - pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement , he never heeded my presence , never troubled himself with so much as a single glance ; but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book . considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous , and especially considering the affectionate arm i had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning , i thought this indifference of his very strange . but savages are strange beings ; at times you do not know exactly how to take them . at first they are overawing ; their calm self - collectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom . i had noticed also that queequeg never consorted at all , or but very little , with the other seamen in the inn . he made no advances whatever ; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances . all this struck me as mighty singular ; yet , upon second thoughts , there was something almost sublime in it . here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home , by the way of cape horn , that is -- which was the only way he could get there -- thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet jupiter ; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease ; preserving the utmost serenity ; content with his own companionship ; always equal to himself . surely this was a touch of fine philosophy ; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that . but , perhaps , to be true philosophers , we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving . so soon as i hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher , i conclude that , like the dyspeptic old woman , he must have \" broken his digester .\" as i sat there in that now lonely room ; the fire burning low , in that mild stage when , after its first intensity has warmed the air , it then only glows to be looked at ; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements , and peering in upon us silent , solitary twain ; the storm booming without in solemn swells ; i began to be sensible of strange feelings . i felt a melting in me . no more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world . this soothing savage had redeemed it . there he sat , his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits . wild he was ; a very sight of sights to see ; yet i began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him . and those same things that would have repelled most others , they were the very magnets that thus drew me . i \\' ll try a pagan friend , thought i , since christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy . i drew my bench near him , and made some friendly signs and hints , doing my best to talk with him meanwhile . at first he little noticed these advances ; but presently , upon my referring to his last night \\' s hospitalities , he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows . i told him yes ; whereat i thought he looked pleased , perhaps a little complimented . we then turned over the book together , and i endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing , and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it . thus i soon engaged his interest ; and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town . soon i proposed a social smoke ; and , producing his pouch and tomahawk , he quietly offered me a puff . and then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his , and keeping it regularly passing between us . if there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagan \\' s breast , this pleasant , genial smoke we had , soon thawed it out , and left us cronies . he seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as i to him ; and when our smoke was over , he pressed his forehead against mine , clasped me round the waist , and said that henceforth we were married ; meaning , in his country \\' s phrase , that we were bosom friends ; he would gladly die for me , if need should be . in a countryman , this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature , a thing to be much distrusted ; but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply . after supper , and another social chat and smoke , we went to our room together . he made me a present of his embalmed head ; took out his enormous tobacco wallet , and groping under the tobacco , drew out some thirty dollars in silver ; then spreading them on the table , and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions , pushed one of them towards me , and said it was mine . i was going to remonstrate ; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers \\' pockets . i let them stay . he then went about his evening prayers , took out his idol , and removed the paper fireboard . by certain signs and symptoms , i thought he seemed anxious for me to join him ; but well knowing what was to follow , i deliberated a moment whether , in case he invited me , i would comply or otherwise . i was a good christian ; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible presbyterian church . how then could i unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood ? but what is worship ? thought i . do you suppose now , ishmael , that the magnanimous god of heaven and earth -- pagans and all included -- can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood ? impossible ! but what is worship ?-- to do the will of god -- that is worship . and what is the will of god ?-- to do to my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to me -- that is the will of god . now , queequeg is my fellow man . and what do i wish that this queequeg would do to me ? why , unite with me in my particular presbyterian form of worship . consequently , i must then unite with him in his ; ergo , i must turn idolator . so i kindled the shavings ; helped prop up the innocent little idol ; offered him burnt biscuit with queequeg ; salamed before him twice or thrice ; kissed his nose ; and that done , we undressed and went to bed , at peace with our own consciences and all the world . but we did not go to sleep without some little chat . how it is i know not ; but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends . man and wife , they say , there open the very bottom of their souls to each other ; and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning . thus , then , in our hearts \\' honeymoon , lay i and queequeg -- a cosy , loving pair . chapter 11 nightgown . we had lain thus in bed , chatting and napping at short intervals , and queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine , and then drawing them back ; so entirely sociable and free and easy were we ; when , at last , by reason of our confabulations , what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed , and we felt like getting up again , though day - break was yet some way down the future . yes , we became very wakeful ; so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome , and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up ; the clothes well tucked around us , leaning against the head - board with our four knees drawn up close together , and our two noses bending over them , as if our kneepans were warming - pans . we felt very nice and snug , the more so since it was so chilly out of doors ; indeed out of bed - clothes too , seeing that there was no fire in the room . the more so , i say , because truly to enjoy bodily warmth , some small part of you must be cold , for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast . nothing exists in itself . if you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable , and have been so a long time , then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more . but if , like queequeg and me in the bed , the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled , why then , indeed , in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm . for this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire , which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich . for the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air . then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal . we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time , when all at once i thought i would open my eyes ; for when between sheets , whether by day or by night , and whether asleep or awake , i have a way of always keeping my eyes shut , in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed . because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed ; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences , though light be more congenial to our clayey part . upon opening my eyes then , and coming out of my own pleasant and self - created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve - o \\' clock - at - night , i experienced a disagreeable revulsion . nor did i at all object to the hint from queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light , seeing that we were so wide awake ; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his tomahawk . be it said , that though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before , yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them . for now i liked nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me , even in bed , because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then . i no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord \\' s policy of insurance . i was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend . with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders , we now passed the tomahawk from one to the other , till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke , illuminated by the flame of the new - lit lamp . whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes , i know not , but he now spoke of his native island ; and , eager to hear his history , i begged him to go on and tell it . he gladly complied . though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of his words , yet subsequent disclosures , when i had become more familiar with his broken phraseology , now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton i give . chapter 12 biographical . queequeg was a native of rokovoko , an island far away to the west and south . it is not down in any map ; true places never are . when a new - hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout , followed by the nibbling goats , as if he were a green sapling ; even then , in queequeg \\' s ambitious soul , lurked a strong desire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two . his father was a high chief , a king ; his uncle a high priest ; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors . there was excellent blood in his veins -- royal stuff ; though sadly vitiated , i fear , by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth . a sag harbor ship visited his father \\' s bay , and queequeg sought a passage to christian lands . but the ship , having her full complement of seamen , spurned his suit ; and not all the king his father \\' s influence could prevail . but queequeg vowed a vow . alone in his canoe , he paddled off to a distant strait , which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island . on one side was a coral reef ; on the other a low tongue of land , covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water . hiding his canoe , still afloat , among these thickets , with its prow seaward , he sat down in the stern , paddle low in hand ; and when the ship was gliding by , like a flash he darted out ; gained her side ; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe ; climbed up the chains ; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck , grappled a ring - bolt there , and swore not to let it go , though hacked in pieces . in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard ; suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists ; queequeg was the son of a king , and queequeg budged not . struck by his desperate dauntlessness , and his wild desire to visit christendom , the captain at last relented , and told him he might make himself at home . but this fine young savage -- this sea prince of wales , never saw the captain \\' s cabin . they put him down among the sailors , and made a whaleman of him . but like czar peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities , queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy , if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen . for at bottom -- so he told me -- he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christians , the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were ; and more than that , still better than they were . but , alas ! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even christians could be both miserable and wicked ; infinitely more so , than all his father \\' s heathens . arrived at last in old sag harbor ; and seeing what the sailors did there ; and then going on to nantucket , and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also , poor queequeg gave it up for lost . thought he , it \\' s a wicked world in all meridians ; i \\' ll die a pagan . and thus an old idolator at heart , he yet lived among these christians , wore their clothes , and tried to talk their gibberish . hence the queer ways about him , though now some time from home . by hints , i asked him whether he did not propose going back , and having a coronation ; since he might now consider his father dead and gone , he being very old and feeble at the last accounts . he answered no , not yet ; and added that he was fearful christianity , or rather christians , had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan kings before him . but by and by , he said , he would return ,-- as soon as he felt himself baptized again . for the nonce , however , he proposed to sail about , and sow his wild oats in all four oceans . they had made a harpooneer of him , and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now . i asked him what might be his immediate purpose , touching his future movements . he answered , to go to sea again , in his old vocation . upon this , i told him that whaling was my own design , and informed him of my intention to sail out of nantucket , as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from . he at once resolved to accompany me to that island , ship aboard the same vessel , get into the same watch , the same boat , the same mess with me , in short to share my every hap ; with both my hands in his , boldly dip into the potluck of both worlds . to all this i joyously assented ; for besides the affection i now felt for queequeg , he was an experienced harpooneer , and as such , could not fail to be of great usefulness to one , who , like me , was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling , though well acquainted with the sea , as known to merchant seamen . his story being ended with his pipe \\' s last dying puff , queequeg embraced me , pressed his forehead against mine , and blowing out the light , we rolled over from each other , this way and that , and very soon were sleeping . chapter 13 wheelbarrow . next morning , monday , after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber , for a block , i settled my own and comrade \\' s bill ; using , however , my comrade \\' s money . the grinning landlord , as well as the boarders , seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and queequeg -- especially as peter coffin \\' s cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom i now companied with . we borrowed a wheelbarrow , and embarking our things , including my own poor carpet - bag , and queequeg \\' s canvas sack and hammock , away we went down to \" the moss ,\" the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf . as we were going along the people stared ; not at queequeg so much -- for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets ,-- but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms . but we heeded them not , going along wheeling the barrow by turns , and queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs . i asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore , and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons . to this , in substance , he replied , that though what i hinted was true enough , yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon , because it was of assured stuff , well tried in many a mortal combat , and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales . in short , like many inland reapers and mowers , who go into the farmers \\' meadows armed with their own scythes -- though in no wise obliged to furnish them -- even so , queequeg , for his own private reasons , preferred his own harpoon . shifting the barrow from my hand to his , he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen . it was in sag harbor . the owners of his ship , it seems , had lent him one , in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house . not to seem ignorant about the thing -- though in truth he was entirely so , concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow -- queequeg puts his chest upon it ; lashes it fast ; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf . \" why ,\" said i , \" queequeg , you might have known better than that , one would think . didn \\' t the people laugh ?\" upon this , he told me another story . the people of his island of rokovoko , it seems , at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl ; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held . now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at rokovoko , and its commander -- from all accounts , a very stately punctilious gentleman , at least for a sea captain -- this commander was invited to the wedding feast of queequeg \\' s sister , a pretty young princess just turned of ten . well ; when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride \\' s bamboo cottage , this captain marches in , and being assigned the post of honour , placed himself over against the punchbowl , and between the high priest and his majesty the king , queequeg \\' s father . grace being said ,-- for those people have their grace as well as we -- though queequeg told me that unlike us , who at such times look downwards to our platters , they , on the contrary , copying the ducks , glance upwards to the great giver of all feasts -- grace , i say , being said , the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island ; that is , dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates . seeing himself placed next the priest , and noting the ceremony , and thinking himself -- being captain of a ship -- as having plain precedence over a mere island king , especially in the king \\' s own house -- the captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl ;-- taking it i suppose for a huge finger - glass . \" now ,\" said queequeg , \" what you tink now ?-- didn \\' t our people laugh ?\" at last , passage paid , and luggage safe , we stood on board the schooner . hoisting sail , it glided down the acushnet river . on one side , new bedford rose in terraces of streets , their ice - covered trees all glittering in the clear , cold air . huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves , and side by side the world - wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last ; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers , with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch , all betokening that new cruises were on the start ; that one most perilous and long voyage ended , only begins a second ; and a second ended , only begins a third , and so on , for ever and for aye . such is the endlessness , yea , the intolerableness of all earthly effort . gaining the more open water , the bracing breeze waxed fresh ; the little moss tossed the quick foam from her bows , as a young colt his snortings . how i snuffed that tartar air !-- how i spurned that turnpike earth !-- that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs ; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records . at the same foam - fountain , queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me . his dusky nostrils swelled apart ; he showed his filed and pointed teeth . on , on we flew ; and our offing gained , the moss did homage to the blast ; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan . sideways leaning , we sideways darted ; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire ; the two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes . so full of this reeling scene were we , as we stood by the plunging bowsprit , that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers , a lubber - like assembly , who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable ; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro . but there were some boobies and bumpkins there , who , by their intense greenness , must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure . queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back . i thought the bumpkin \\' s hour of doom was come . dropping his harpoon , the brawny savage caught him in his arms , and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength , sent him high up bodily into the air ; then slightly tapping his stern in mid - somerset , the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet , while queequeg , turning his back upon him , lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff . \" capting ! capting ! yelled the bumpkin , running towards that officer ; \" capting , capting , here \\' s the devil .\" \" hallo , you sir ,\" cried the captain , a gaunt rib of the sea , stalking up to queequeg , \" what in thunder do you mean by that ? don \\' t you know you might have killed that chap ?\" \" what him say ?\" said queequeg , as he mildly turned to me . \" he say ,\" said i , \" that you came near kill - e that man there ,\" pointing to the still shivering greenhorn . \" kill - e ,\" cried queequeg , twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain , \" ah ! him bevy small - e fish - e ; queequeg no kill - e so small - e fish - e ; queequeg kill - e big whale !\" \" look you ,\" roared the captain , \" i \\' ll kill - e you , you cannibal , if you try any more of your tricks aboard here ; so mind your eye .\" but it so happened just then , that it was high time for the captain to mind his own eye . the prodigious strain upon the main - sail had parted the weather - sheet , and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side , completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck . the poor fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly , was swept overboard ; all hands were in a panic ; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it , seemed madness . it flew from right to left , and back again , almost in one ticking of a watch , and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters . nothing was done , and nothing seemed capable of being done ; those on deck rushed towards the bows , and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale . in the midst of this consternation , queequeg dropped deftly to his knees , and crawling under the path of the boom , whipped hold of a rope , secured one end to the bulwarks , and then flinging the other like a lasso , caught it round the boom as it swept over his head , and at the next jerk , the spar was that way trapped , and all was safe . the schooner was run into the wind , and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat , queequeg , stripped to the waist , darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap . for three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog , throwing his long arms straight out before him , and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam . i looked at the grand and glorious fellow , but saw no one to be saved . the greenhorn had gone down . shooting himself perpendicularly from the water , queequeg , now took an instant \\' s glance around him , and seeming to see just how matters were , dived down and disappeared . a few minutes more , and he rose again , one arm still striking out , and with the other dragging a lifeless form . the boat soon picked them up . the poor bumpkin was restored . all hands voted queequeg a noble trump ; the captain begged his pardon . from that hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle ; yea , till poor queequeg took his last long dive . was there ever such unconsciousness ? he did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies . he only asked for water -- fresh water -- something to wipe the brine off ; that done , he put on dry clothes , lighted his pipe , and leaning against the bulwarks , and mildly eyeing those around him , seemed to be saying to himself --\" it \\' s a mutual , joint - stock world , in all meridians . we cannibals must help these christians .\" chapter 14 nantucket . nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning ; so , after a fine run , we safely arrived in nantucket . nantucket ! take out your map and look at it . see what a real corner of the world it occupies ; how it stands there , away off shore , more lonely than the eddystone lighthouse . look at it -- a mere hillock , and elbow of sand ; all beach , without a background . there is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper . some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there , they don \\' t grow naturally ; that they import canada thistles ; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask ; that pieces of wood in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in rome ; that people there plant toadstools before their houses , to get under the shade in summer time ; that one blade of grass makes an oasis , three blades in a day \\' s walk a prairie ; that they wear quicksand shoes , something like laplander snow - shoes ; that they are so shut up , belted about , every way inclosed , surrounded , and made an utter island of by the ocean , that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering , as to the backs of sea turtles . but these extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois . look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the red - men . thus goes the legend . in olden times an eagle swooped down upon the new england coast , and carried off an infant indian in his talons . with loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters . they resolved to follow in the same direction . setting out in their canoes , after a perilous passage they discovered the island , and there they found an empty ivory casket ,-- the poor little indian \\' s skeleton . what wonder , then , that these nantucketers , born on a beach , should take to the sea for a livelihood ! they first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand ; grown bolder , they waded out with nets for mackerel ; more experienced , they pushed off in boats and captured cod ; and at last , launching a navy of great ships on the sea , explored this watery world ; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it ; peeped in at behring \\' s straits ; and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood ; most monstrous and most mountainous ! that himmalehan , salt - sea mastodon , clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power , that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults ! and thus have these naked nantucketers , these sea hermits , issuing from their ant - hill in the sea , overrun and conquered the watery world like so many alexanders ; parcelling out among them the atlantic , pacific , and indian oceans , as the three pirate powers did poland . let america add mexico to texas , and pile cuba upon canada ; let the english overswarm all india , and hang out their blazing banner from the sun ; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketer \\' s . for the sea is his ; he owns it , as emperors own empires ; other seamen having but a right of way through it . merchant ships are but extension bridges ; armed ones but floating forts ; even pirates and privateers , though following the sea as highwaymen the road , they but plunder other ships , other fragments of the land like themselves , without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself . the nantucketer , he alone resides and riots on the sea ; he alone , in bible language , goes down to it in ships ; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation . there is his home ; there lies his business , which a noah \\' s flood would not interrupt , though it overwhelmed all the millions in china . he lives on the sea , as prairie cocks in the prairie ; he hides among the waves , he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the alps . for years he knows not the land ; so that when he comes to it at last , it smells like another world , more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman . with the landless gull , that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows ; so at nightfall , the nantucketer , out of sight of land , furls his sails , and lays him to his rest , while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales . chapter 15 chowder . it was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to anchor , and queequeg and i went ashore ; so we could attend to no business that day , at least none but a supper and a bed . the landlord of the spouter - inn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of the try pots , whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all nantucket , and moreover he had assured us that cousin hosea , as he called him , was famous for his chowders . in short , he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot - luck at the try pots . but the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard , and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard , and that done , then ask the first man we met where the place was : these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first , especially as , at the outset , queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse -- our first point of departure -- must be left on the larboard hand , whereas i had understood peter coffin to say it was on the starboard . however , by dint of beating about a little in the dark , and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way , we at last came to something which there was no mistaking . two enormous wooden pots painted black , and suspended by asses \\' ears , swung from the cross - trees of an old top - mast , planted in front of an old doorway . the horns of the cross - trees were sawed off on the other side , so that this old top - mast looked not a little like a gallows . perhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time , but i could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving . a sort of crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns ; yes , two of them , one for queequeg , and one for me . it \\' s ominous , thinks i . a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port ; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen \\' s chapel ; and here a gallows ! and a pair of prodigious black pots too ! are these last throwing out oblique hints touching tophet ? i was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown , standing in the porch of the inn , under a dull red lamp swinging there , that looked much like an injured eye , and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt . \" get along with ye ,\" said she to the man , \" or i \\' ll be combing ye !\" \" come on , queequeg ,\" said i , \" all right . there \\' s mrs . hussey .\" and so it turned out ; mr . hosea hussey being from home , but leaving mrs . hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs . upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed , mrs . hussey , postponing further scolding for the present , ushered us into a little room , and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast , turned round to us and said --\" clam or cod ?\" \" what \\' s that about cods , ma \\' am ?\" said i , with much politeness . \" clam or cod ?\" she repeated . \" a clam for supper ? a cold clam ; is that what you mean , mrs . hussey ?\" says i , \" but that \\' s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time , ain \\' t it , mrs . hussey ?\" but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt , who was waiting for it in the entry , and seeming to hear nothing but the word \" clam ,\" mrs . hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen , and bawling out \" clam for two ,\" disappeared . \" queequeg ,\" said i , \" do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam ?\" however , a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us . but when that smoking chowder came in , the mystery was delightfully explained . oh , sweet friends ! hearken to me . it was made of small juicy clams , scarcely bigger than hazel nuts , mixed with pounded ship biscuit , and salted pork cut up into little flakes ; the whole enriched with butter , and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt . our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage , and in particular , queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him , and the chowder being surpassingly excellent , we despatched it with great expedition : when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of mrs . hussey \\' s clam and cod announcement , i thought i would try a little experiment . stepping to the kitchen door , i uttered the word \" cod \" with great emphasis , and resumed my seat . in a few moments the savoury steam came forth again , but with a different flavor , and in good time a fine cod - chowder was placed before us . we resumed business ; and while plying our spoons in the bowl , thinks i to myself , i wonder now if this here has any effect on the head ? what \\' s that stultifying saying about chowder - headed people ? \" but look , queequeg , ain \\' t that a live eel in your bowl ? where \\' s your harpoon ?\" fishiest of all fishy places was the try pots , which well deserved its name ; for the pots there were always boiling chowders . chowder for breakfast , and chowder for dinner , and chowder for supper , till you began to look for fish - bones coming through your clothes . the area before the house was paved with clam - shells . mrs . hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra ; and hosea hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark - skin . there was a fishy flavor to the milk , too , which i could not at all account for , till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen \\' s boats , i saw hosea \\' s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants , and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod \\' s decapitated head , looking very slip - shod , i assure ye . supper concluded , we received a lamp , and directions from mrs . hussey concerning the nearest way to bed ; but , as queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs , the lady reached forth her arm , and demanded his harpoon ; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers . \" why not ? said i ; \" every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon -- but why not ?\" \" because it \\' s dangerous ,\" says she . \" ever since young stiggs coming from that unfort \\' nt v \\' y \\' ge of his , when he was gone four years and a half , with only three barrels of ile , was found dead in my first floor back , with his harpoon in his side ; ever since then i allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night . so , mr . queequeg \" ( for she had learned his name ), \" i will just take this here iron , and keep it for you till morning . but the chowder ; clam or cod to - morrow for breakfast , men ?\" \" both ,\" says i ; \" and let \\' s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety .\" chapter 16 the ship . in bed we concocted our plans for the morrow . but to my surprise and no small concern , queequeg now gave me to understand , that he had been diligently consulting yojo -- the name of his black little god -- and yojo had told him two or three times over , and strongly insisted upon it everyway , that instead of our going together among the whaling - fleet in harbor , and in concert selecting our craft ; instead of this , i say , yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me , inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us ; and , in order to do so , had already pitched upon a vessel , which , if left to myself , i , ishmael , should infallibly light upon , for all the world as though it had turned out by chance ; and in that vessel i must immediately ship myself , for the present irrespective of queequeg . i have forgotten to mention that , in many things , queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of yojo \\' s judgment and surprising forecast of things ; and cherished yojo with considerable esteem , as a rather good sort of god , who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole , but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs . now , this plan of queequeg \\' s , or rather yojo \\' s , touching the selection of our craft ; i did not like that plan at all . i had not a little relied upon queequeg \\' s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely . but as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon queequeg , i was obliged to acquiesce ; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor , that should quickly settle that trifling little affair . next morning early , leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in our little bedroom -- for it seemed that it was some sort of lent or ramadan , or day of fasting , humiliation , and prayer with queequeg and yojo that day ; how it was i never could find out , for , though i applied myself to it several times , i never could master his liturgies and xxxix articles -- leaving queequeg , then , fasting on his tomahawk pipe , and yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings , i sallied out among the shipping . after much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries , i learnt that there were three ships up for three - years \\' voyages -- the devil - dam , the tit - bit , and the pequod . devil - dam , i do not know the origin of ; tit - bit is obvious ; pequod , you will no doubt remember , was the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians ; now extinct as the ancient medes . i peered and pryed about the devil - dam ; from her , hopped over to the tit - bit ; and finally , going on board the pequod , looked around her for a moment , and then decided that this was the very ship for us . you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day , for aught i know ;-- square - toed luggers ; mountainous japanese junks ; butter - box galliots , and what not ; but take my word for it , you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old pequod . she was a ship of the old school , rather small if anything ; with an old - fashioned claw - footed look about her . long seasoned and weather - stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans , her old hull \\' s complexion was darkened like a french grenadier \\' s , who has alike fought in egypt and siberia . her venerable bows looked bearded . her masts -- cut somewhere on the coast of japan , where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale -- her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne . her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled , like the pilgrim - worshipped flag - stone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled . but to all these her old antiquities , were added new and marvellous features , pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed . old captain peleg , many years her chief - mate , before he commanded another vessel of his own , and now a retired seaman , and one of the principal owners of the pequod ,-- this old peleg , during the term of his chief - mateship , had built upon her original grotesqueness , and inlaid it , all over , with a quaintness both of material and device , unmatched by anything except it be thorkill - hake \\' s carved buckler or bedstead . she was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor , his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory . she was a thing of trophies . a cannibal of a craft , tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies . all round , her unpanelled , open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw , with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale , inserted there for pins , to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to . those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood , but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea - ivory . scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm , she sported there a tiller ; and that tiller was in one mass , curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe . the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest , felt like the tartar , when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw . a noble craft , but somehow a most melancholy ! all noble things are touched with that . now when i looked about the quarter - deck , for some one having authority , in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage , at first i saw nobody ; but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent , or rather wigwam , pitched a little behind the main - mast . it seemed only a temporary erection used in port . it was of a conical shape , some ten feet high ; consisting of the long , huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right - whale . planted with their broad ends on the deck , a circle of these slabs laced together , mutually sloped towards each other , and at the apex united in a tufted point , where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top - knot on some old pottowottamie sachem \\' s head . a triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship , so that the insider commanded a complete view forward . and half concealed in this queer tenement , i at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority ; and who , it being noon , and the ship \\' s work suspended , was now enjoying respite from the burden of command . he was seated on an old - fashioned oaken chair , wriggling all over with curious carving ; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed . there was nothing so very particular , perhaps , about the appearance of the elderly man i saw ; he was brown and brawny , like most old seamen , and heavily rolled up in blue pilot - cloth , cut in the quaker style ; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net - work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes , which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales , and always looking to windward ;-- for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together . such eye - wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl . \" is this the captain of the pequod ?\" said i , advancing to the door of the tent . \" supposing it be the captain of the pequod , what dost thou want of him ?\" he demanded . \" i was thinking of shipping .\" \" thou wast , wast thou ? i see thou art no nantucketer -- ever been in a stove boat ?\" \" no , sir , i never have .\" \" dost know nothing at all about whaling , i dare say -- eh ? \" nothing , sir ; but i have no doubt i shall soon learn . i \\' ve been several voyages in the merchant service , and i think that --\" \" merchant service be damned . talk not that lingo to me . dost see that leg ?-- i \\' ll take that leg away from thy stern , if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again . marchant service indeed ! i suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships . but flukes ! man , what makes thee want to go a whaling , eh ?-- it looks a little suspicious , don \\' t it , eh ?-- hast not been a pirate , hast thou ?-- didst not rob thy last captain , didst thou ?-- dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea ?\" i protested my innocence of these things . i saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes , this old seaman , as an insulated quakerish nantucketer , was full of his insular prejudices , and rather distrustful of all aliens , unless they hailed from cape cod or the vineyard . \" but what takes thee a - whaling ? i want to know that before i think of shipping ye .\" \" well , sir , i want to see what whaling is . i want to see the world .\" \" want to see what whaling is , eh ? have ye clapped eye on captain ahab ?\" \" who is captain ahab , sir ?\" \" aye , aye , i thought so . captain ahab is the captain of this ship .\" \" i am mistaken then . i thought i was speaking to the captain himself .\" \" thou art speaking to captain peleg -- that \\' s who ye are speaking to , young man . it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted out for the voyage , and supplied with all her needs , including crew . we are part owners and agents . but as i was going to say , if thou wantest to know what whaling is , as thou tellest ye do , i can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it , past backing out . clap eye on captain ahab , young man , and thou wilt find that he has only one leg .\" \" what do you mean , sir ? was the other one lost by a whale ?\" \" lost by a whale ! young man , come nearer to me : it was devoured , chewed up , crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat !-- ah , ah !\" i was a little alarmed by his energy , perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation , but said as calmly as i could , \" what you say is no doubt true enough , sir ; but how could i know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale , though indeed i might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident .\" \" look ye now , young man , thy lungs are a sort of soft , d \\' ye see ; thou dost not talk shark a bit . sure , ye \\' ve been to sea before now ; sure of that ?\" \" sir ,\" said i , \" i thought i told you that i had been four voyages in the merchant --\" \" hard down out of that ! mind what i said about the marchant service -- don \\' t aggravate me -- i won \\' t have it . but let us understand each other . i have given thee a hint about what whaling is ; do ye yet feel inclined for it ?\" \" i do , sir .\" \" very good . now , art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale \\' s throat , and then jump after it ? answer , quick !\" \" i am , sir , if it should be positively indispensable to do so ; not to be got rid of , that is ; which i don \\' t take to be the fact .\" \" good again . now then , thou not only wantest to go a - whaling , to find out by experience what whaling is , but ye also want to go in order to see the world ? was not that what ye said ? i thought so . well then , just step forward there , and take a peep over the weather - bow , and then back to me and tell me what ye see there .\" for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request , not knowing exactly how to take it , whether humorously or in earnest . but concentrating all his crow \\' s feet into one scowl , captain peleg started me on the errand . going forward and glancing over the weather bow , i perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood - tide , was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean . the prospect was unlimited , but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding ; not the slightest variety that i could see . \" well , what \\' s the report ?\" said peleg when i came back ; \" what did ye see ?\" \" not much ,\" i replied --\" nothing but water ; considerable horizon though , and there \\' s a squall coming up , i think .\" \" well , what does thou think then of seeing the world ? do ye wish to go round cape horn to see any more of it , eh ? can \\' t ye see the world where you stand ?\" i was a little staggered , but go a - whaling i must , and i would ; and the pequod was as good a ship as any -- i thought the best -- and all this i now repeated to peleg . seeing me so determined , he expressed his willingness to ship me . \" and thou mayest as well sign the papers right off ,\" he added --\" come along with ye .\" and so saying , he led the way below deck into the cabin . seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure . it turned out to be captain bildad , who along with captain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel ; the other shares , as is sometimes the case in these ports , being held by a crowd of old annuitants ; widows , fatherless children , and chancery wards ; each owning about the value of a timber head , or a foot of plank , or a nail or two in the ship . people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels , the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest . now , bildad , like peleg , and indeed many other nantucketers , was a quaker , the island having been originally settled by that sect ; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the quaker , only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous . for some of these same quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale - hunters . they are fighting quakers ; they are quakers with a vengeance . so that there are instances among them of men , who , named with scripture names -- a singularly common fashion on the island -- and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker idiom ; still , from the audacious , daring , and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives , strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities , a thousand bold dashes of character , not unworthy a scandinavian sea - king , or a poetical pagan roman . and when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force , with a globular brain and a ponderous heart ; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night - watches in the remotest waters , and beneath constellations never seen here at the north , been led to think untraditionally and independently ; receiving all nature \\' s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast , and thereby chiefly , but with some help from accidental advantages , to learn a bold and nervous lofty language -- that man makes one in a whole nation \\' s census -- a mighty pageant creature , formed for noble tragedies . nor will it at all detract from him , dramatically regarded , if either by birth or other circumstances , he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature . for all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness . be sure of this , o young ambition , all mortal greatness is but disease . but , as yet we have not to do with such an one , but with quite another ; and still a man , who , if indeed peculiar , it only results again from another phase of the quaker , modified by individual circumstances . like captain peleg , captain bildad was a well - to - do , retired whaleman . but unlike captain peleg -- who cared not a rush for what are called serious things , and indeed deemed those self - same serious things the veriest of all trifles -- captain bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism , but all his subsequent ocean life , and the sight of many unclad , lovely island creatures , round the horn -- all that had not moved this native born quaker one single jot , had not so much as altered one angle of his vest . still , for all this immutableness , was there some lack of common consistency about worthy captain peleg . though refusing , from conscientious scruples , to bear arms against land invaders , yet himself had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific ; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed , yet had he in his straight - bodied coat , spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore . how now in the contemplative evening of his days , the pious bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence , i do not know ; but it did not seem to concern him much , and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man \\' s religion is one thing , and this practical world quite another . this world pays dividends . rising from a little cabin - boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab , to a harpooneer in a broad shad - bellied waistcoat ; from that becoming boat - header , chief - mate , and captain , and finally a ship owner ; bildad , as i hinted before , had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty , and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well - earned income . now , bildad , i am sorry to say , had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks , and in his sea - going days , a bitter , hard task - master . they told me in nantucket , though it certainly seems a curious story , that when he sailed the old categut whaleman , his crew , upon arriving home , were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital , sore exhausted and worn out . for a pious man , especially for a quaker , he was certainly rather hard - hearted , to say the least . he never used to swear , though , at his men , they said ; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel , unmitigated hard work out of them . when bildad was a chief - mate , to have his drab - coloured eye intently looking at you , made you feel completely nervous , till you could clutch something -- a hammer or a marling - spike , and go to work like mad , at something or other , never mind what . indolence and idleness perished before him . his own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character . on his long , gaunt body , he carried no spare flesh , no superfluous beard , his chin having a soft , economical nap to it , like the worn nap of his broad - brimmed hat . such , then , was the person that i saw seated on the transom when i followed captain peleg down into the cabin . the space between the decks was small ; and there , bolt - upright , sat old bildad , who always sat so , and never leaned , and this to save his coat tails . his broad - brim was placed beside him ; his legs were stiffly crossed ; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin ; and spectacles on nose , he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume . \" bildad ,\" cried captain peleg , \" at it again , bildad , eh ? ye have been studying those scriptures , now , for the last thirty years , to my certain knowledge . how far ye got , bildad ?\" as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate , bildad , without noticing his present irreverence , quietly looked up , and seeing me , glanced again inquiringly towards peleg . \" he says he \\' s our man , bildad ,\" said peleg , \" he wants to ship .\" \" dost thee ?\" said bildad , in a hollow tone , and turning round to me . \" i dost ,\" said i unconsciously , he was so intense a quaker . \" what do ye think of him , bildad ?\" said peleg . \" he \\' ll do ,\" said bildad , eyeing me , and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible . i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw , especially as peleg , his friend and old shipmate , seemed such a blusterer . but i said nothing , only looking round me sharply . peleg now threw open a chest , and drawing forth the ship \\' s articles , placed pen and ink before him , and seated himself at a little table . i began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for the voyage . i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages ; but all hands , including the captain , received certain shares of the profits called lays , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship \\' s company . i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling , my own lay would not be very large ; but considering that i was used to the sea , could steer a ship , splice a rope , and all that , i made no doubt that from all i had heard i should be offered at least the 275th lay -- that is , the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage , whatever that might eventually amount to . and though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay , yet it was better than nothing ; and if we had a lucky voyage , might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it , not to speak of my three years \\' beef and board , for which i would not have to pay one stiver . it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune -- and so it was , a very poor way indeed . but i am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes , and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me , while i am putting up at this grim sign of the thunder cloud . upon the whole , i thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing , but would not have been surprised had i been offered the 200th , considering i was of a broad - shouldered make . but one thing , nevertheless , that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this : ashore , i had heard something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad ; how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod , therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners , left nearly the whole management of the ship \\' s affairs to these two . and i did not know but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands , especially as i now found him on board the pequod , quite at home there in the cabin , and reading his bible as if at his own fireside . now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack - knife , old bildad , to my no small surprise , considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings ; bildad never heeded us , but went on mumbling to himself out of his book , \" lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth , where moth --\" \" well , captain bildad ,\" interrupted peleg , \" what d \\' ye say , what lay shall we give this young man ?\" \" thou knowest best ,\" was the sepulchral reply , \" the seven hundred and seventy - seventh wouldn \\' t be too much , would it ?--\\' where moth and rust do corrupt , but lay --\\'\" lay , indeed , thought i , and such a lay ! the seven hundred and seventy - seventh ! well , old bildad , you are determined that i , for one , shall not lay up many lays here below , where moth and rust do corrupt . it was an exceedingly long lay that , indeed ; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman , yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy - seven is a pretty large number , yet , when you come to make a teenth of it , you will then see , i say , that the seven hundred and seventy - seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy - seven gold doubloons ; and so i thought at the time . \" why , blast your eyes , bildad ,\" cried peleg , \" thou dost not want to swindle this young man ! he must have more than that .\" \" seven hundred and seventy - seventh ,\" again said bildad , without lifting his eyes ; and then went on mumbling --\" for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .\" \" i am going to put him down for the three hundredth ,\" said peleg , \" do ye hear that , bildad ! the three hundredth lay , i say .\" bildad laid down his book , and turning solemnly towards him said , \" captain peleg , thou hast a generous heart ; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship -- widows and orphans , many of them -- and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man , we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans . the seven hundred and seventy - seventh lay , captain peleg .\" \" thou bildad !\" roared peleg , starting up and clattering about the cabin . \" blast ye , captain bildad , if i had followed thy advice in these matters , i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape horn .\" \" captain peleg ,\" said bildad steadily , \" thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water , or ten fathoms , i can \\' t tell ; but as thou art still an impenitent man , captain peleg , i greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one ; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit , captain peleg .\" \" fiery pit ! fiery pit ! ye insult me , man ; past all natural bearing , ye insult me . it \\' s an all - fired outrage to tell any human creature that he \\' s bound to hell . flukes and flames ! bildad , say that again to me , and start my soul - bolts , but i \\' ll -- i \\' ll -- yes , i \\' ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on . out of the cabin , ye canting , drab - coloured son of a wooden gun -- a straight wake with ye !\" as he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad , but with a marvellous oblique , sliding celerity , bildad for that time eluded him . alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship , and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded , i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad , who , i made no doubt , was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of peleg . but to my astonishment , he sat down again on the transom very quietly , and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing . he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways . as for peleg , after letting off his rage as he had , there seemed no more left in him , and he , too , sat down like a lamb , though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated . \" whew !\" he whistled at last --\" the squall \\' s gone off to leeward , i think . bildad , thou used to be good at sharpening a lance , mend that pen , will ye . my jack - knife here needs the grindstone . that \\' s he ; thank ye , bildad . now then , my young man , ishmael \\' s thy name , didn \\' t ye say ? well then , down ye go here , ishmael , for the three hundredth lay .\" \" captain peleg ,\" said i , \" i have a friend with me who wants to ship too -- shall i bring him down to - morrow ?\" \" to be sure ,\" said peleg . \" fetch him along , and we \\' ll look at him .\" \" what lay does he want ?\" groaned bildad , glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself . \" oh ! never thee mind about that , bildad ,\" said peleg . \" has he ever whaled it any ?\" turning to me . \" killed more whales than i can count , captain peleg .\" \" well , bring him along then .\" and , after signing the papers , off i went ; nothing doubting but that i had done a good morning \\' s work , and that the pequod was the identical ship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape . but i had not proceeded far , when i began to bethink me that the captain with whom i was to sail yet remained unseen by me ; though , indeed , in many cases , a whale - ship will be completely fitted out , and receive all her crew on board , ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command ; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged , and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief , that if the captain have a family , or any absorbing concernment of that sort , he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port , but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea . however , it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands . turning back i accosted captain peleg , inquiring where captain ahab was to be found . \" and what dost thou want of captain ahab ? it \\' s all right enough ; thou art shipped .\" \" yes , but i should like to see him .\" \" but i don \\' t think thou wilt be able to at present . i don \\' t know exactly what \\' s the matter with him ; but he keeps close inside the house ; a sort of sick , and yet he don \\' t look so . in fact , he ain \\' t sick ; but no , he isn \\' t well either . any how , young man , he won \\' t always see me , so i don \\' t suppose he will thee . he \\' s a queer man , captain ahab -- so some think -- but a good one . oh , thou \\' lt like him well enough ; no fear , no fear . he \\' s a grand , ungodly , god - like man , captain ahab ; doesn \\' t speak much ; but , when he does speak , then you may well listen . mark ye , be forewarned ; ahab \\' s above the common ; ahab \\' s been in colleges , as well as \\' mong the cannibals ; been used to deeper wonders than the waves ; fixed his fiery lance in mightier , stranger foes than whales . his lance ! aye , the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle ! oh ! he ain \\' t captain bildad ; no , and he ain \\' t captain peleg ; he \\' s ahab , boy ; and ahab of old , thou knowest , was a crowned king !\" \" and a very vile one . when that wicked king was slain , the dogs , did they not lick his blood ?\" \" come hither to me -- hither , hither ,\" said peleg , with a significance in his eye that almost startled me . \" look ye , lad ; never say that on board the pequod . never say it anywhere . captain ahab did not name himself . \\' twas a foolish , ignorant whim of his crazy , widowed mother , who died when he was only a twelvemonth old . and yet the old squaw tistig , at gayhead , said that the name would somehow prove prophetic . and , perhaps , other fools like her may tell thee the same . i wish to warn thee . it \\' s a lie . i know captain ahab well ; i \\' ve sailed with him as mate years ago ; i know what he is -- a good man -- not a pious , good man , like bildad , but a swearing good man -- something like me -- only there \\' s a good deal more of him . aye , aye , i know that he was never very jolly ; and i know that on the passage home , he was a little out of his mind for a spell ; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about , as any one might see . i know , too , that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale , he \\' s been a kind of moody -- desperate moody , and savage sometimes ; but that will all pass off . and once for all , let me tell thee and assure thee , young man , it \\' s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one . so good - bye to thee -- and wrong not captain ahab , because he happens to have a wicked name . besides , my boy , he has a wife -- not three voyages wedded -- a sweet , resigned girl . think of that ; by that sweet girl that old man has a child : hold ye then there can be any utter , hopeless harm in ahab ? no , no , my lad ; stricken , blasted , if he be , ahab has his humanities !\" as i walked away , i was full of thoughtfulness ; what had been incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab , filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him . and somehow , at the time , i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him , but for i don \\' t know what , unless it was the cruel loss of his leg . and yet i also felt a strange awe of him ; but that sort of awe , which i cannot at all describe , was not exactly awe ; i do not know what it was . but i felt it ; and it did not disincline me towards him ; though i felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him , so imperfectly as he was known to me then . however , my thoughts were at length carried in other directions , so that for the present dark ahab slipped my mind . chapter 17 the ramadan . as queequeg \\' s ramadan , or fasting and humiliation , was to continue all day , i did not choose to disturb him till towards night - fall ; for i cherish the greatest respect towards everybody \\' s religious obligations , never mind how comical , and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad - stool ; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth , who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets , bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name . i say , we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these things , and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals , pagans and what not , because of their half - crazy conceits on these subjects . there was queequeg , now , certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about yojo and his ramadan ;-- but what of that ? queequeg thought he knew what he was about , i suppose ; he seemed to be content ; and there let him rest . all our arguing with him would not avail ; let him be , i say : and heaven have mercy on us all -- presbyterians and pagans alike -- for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head , and sadly need mending . towards evening , when i felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over , i went up to his room and knocked at the door ; but no answer . i tried to open it , but it was fastened inside . \" queequeg ,\" said i softly through the key - hole :-- all silent . \" i say , queequeg ! why don \\' t you speak ? it \\' s i -- ishmael .\" but all remained still as before . i began to grow alarmed . i had allowed him such abundant time ; i thought he might have had an apoplectic fit . i looked through the key - hole ; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room , the key - hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one . i could only see part of the foot - board of the bed and a line of the wall , but nothing more . i was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of queequeg \\' s harpoon , which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him , before our mounting to the chamber . that \\' s strange , thought i ; but at any rate , since the harpoon stands yonder , and he seldom or never goes abroad without it , therefore he must be inside here , and no possible mistake . \" queequeg !-- queequeg !\"-- all still . something must have happened . apoplexy ! i tried to burst open the door ; but it stubbornly resisted . running down stairs , i quickly stated my suspicions to the first person i met -- the chamber - maid . \" la ! la !\" she cried , \" i thought something must be the matter . i went to make the bed after breakfast , and the door was locked ; and not a mouse to be heard ; and it \\' s been just so silent ever since . but i thought , may be , you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping . la ! la , ma \\' am !-- mistress ! murder ! mrs . hussey ! apoplexy !\"-- and with these cries , she ran towards the kitchen , i following . mrs . hussey soon appeared , with a mustard - pot in one hand and a vinegar - cruet in the other , having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castors , and scolding her little black boy meantime . \" wood - house !\" cried i , \" which way to it ? run for god \\' s sake , and fetch something to pry open the door -- the axe !-- the axe ! he \\' s had a stroke ; depend upon it !\"-- and so saying i was unmethodically rushing up stairs again empty - handed , when mrs . hussey interposed the mustard - pot and vinegar - cruet , and the entire castor of her countenance . \" what \\' s the matter with you , young man ?\" \" get the axe ! for god \\' s sake , run for the doctor , some one , while i pry it open !\" \" look here ,\" said the landlady , quickly putting down the vinegar - cruet , so as to have one hand free ; \" look here ; are you talking about prying open any of my doors ?\"-- and with that she seized my arm . \" what \\' s the matter with you ? what \\' s the matter with you , shipmate ?\" in as calm , but rapid a manner as possible , i gave her to understand the whole case . unconsciously clapping the vinegar - cruet to one side of her nose , she ruminated for an instant ; then exclaimed --\" no ! i haven \\' t seen it since i put it there .\" running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs , she glanced in , and returning , told me that queequeg \\' s harpoon was missing . \" he \\' s killed himself ,\" she cried . \" it \\' s unfort \\' nate stiggs done over again there goes another counterpane -- god pity his poor mother !-- it will be the ruin of my house . has the poor lad a sister ? where \\' s that girl ?-- there , betty , go to snarles the painter , and tell him to paint me a sign , with --\" no suicides permitted here , and no smoking in the parlor ;\"-- might as well kill both birds at once . kill ? the lord be merciful to his ghost ! what \\' s that noise there ? you , young man , avast there !\" and running up after me , she caught me as i was again trying to force open the door . \" i don \\' t allow it ; i won \\' t have my premises spoiled . go for the locksmith , there \\' s one about a mile from here . but avast !\" putting her hand in her side - pocket , \" here \\' s a key that \\' ll fit , i guess ; let \\' s see .\" and with that , she turned it in the lock ; but , alas ! queequeg \\' s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within . \" have to burst it open ,\" said i , and was running down the entry a little , for a good start , when the landlady caught at me , again vowing i should not break down her premises ; but i tore from her , and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark . with a prodigious noise the door flew open , and the knob slamming against the wall , sent the plaster to the ceiling ; and there , good heavens ! there sat queequeg , altogether cool and self - collected ; right in the middle of the room ; squatting on his hams , and holding yojo on top of his head . he looked neither one way nor the other way , but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life . \" queequeg ,\" said i , going up to him , \" queequeg , what \\' s the matter with you ?\" \" he hain \\' t been a sittin \\' so all day , has he ?\" said the landlady . but all we said , not a word could we drag out of him ; i almost felt like pushing him over , so as to change his position , for it was almost intolerable , it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained ; especially , as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours , going too without his regular meals . \" mrs . hussey ,\" said i , \" he \\' s alive at all events ; so leave us , if you please , and i will see to this strange affair myself .\" closing the door upon the landlady , i endeavored to prevail upon queequeg to take a chair ; but in vain . there he sat ; and all he could do -- for all my polite arts and blandishments -- he would not move a peg , nor say a single word , nor even look at me , nor notice my presence in the slightest way . i wonder , thought i , if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan ; do they fast on their hams that way in his native island . it must be so ; yes , it \\' s part of his creed , i suppose ; well , then , let him rest ; he \\' ll get up sooner or later , no doubt . it can \\' t last for ever , thank god , and his ramadan only comes once a year ; and i don \\' t believe it \\' s very punctual then . i went down to supper . after sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum - pudding voyage , as they called it ( that is , a short whaling - voyage in a schooner or brig , confined to the north of the line , in the atlantic ocean only ); after listening to these plum - puddingers till nearly eleven o \\' clock , i went up stairs to go to bed , feeling quite sure by this time queequeg must certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination . but no ; there he was just where i had left him ; he had not stirred an inch . i began to grow vexed with him ; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room , holding a piece of wood on his head . \" for heaven \\' s sake , queequeg , get up and shake yourself ; get up and have some supper . you \\' ll starve ; you \\' ll kill yourself , queequeg .\" but not a word did he reply . despairing of him , therefore , i determined to go to bed and to sleep ; and no doubt , before a great while , he would follow me . but previous to turning in , i took my heavy bearskin jacket , and threw it over him , as it promised to be a very cold night ; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on . for some time , do all i would , i could not get into the faintest doze . i had blown out the candle ; and the mere thought of queequeg -- not four feet off -- sitting there in that uneasy position , stark alone in the cold and dark ; this made me really wretched . think of it ; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary , unaccountable ramadan ! but somehow i dropped off at last , and knew nothing more till break of day ; when , looking over the bedside , there squatted queequeg , as if he had been screwed down to the floor . but as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window , up he got , with stiff and grating joints , but with a cheerful look ; limped towards me where i lay ; pressed his forehead again against mine ; and said his ramadan was over . now , as i before hinted , i have no objection to any person \\' s religion , be it what it may , so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person , because that other person don \\' t believe it also . but when a man \\' s religion becomes really frantic ; when it is a positive torment to him ; and , in fine , makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in ; then i think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him . and just so i now did with queequeg . \" queequeg ,\" said i , \" get into bed now , and lie and listen to me .\" i then went on , beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions , and coming down to the various religions of the present time , during which time i labored to show queequeg that all these lents , ramadans , and prolonged ham - squattings in cold , cheerless rooms were stark nonsense ; bad for the health ; useless for the soul ; opposed , in short , to the obvious laws of hygiene and common sense . i told him , too , that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage , it pained me , very badly pained me , to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan of his . besides , argued i , fasting makes the body cave in ; hence the spirit caves in ; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half - starved . this is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters . in one word , queequeg , said i , rather digressively ; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple - dumpling ; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by ramadans . i then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia ; expressing the idea very plainly , so that he could take it in . he said no ; only upon one memorable occasion . it was after a great feast given by his father the king , on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o \\' clock in the afternoon , and all cooked and eaten that very evening . \" no more , queequeg ,\" said i , shuddering ; \" that will do ;\" for i knew the inferences without his further hinting them . i had seen a sailor who had visited that very island , and he told me that it was the custom , when a great battle had been gained there , to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor ; and then , one by one , they were placed in great wooden trenchers , and garnished round like a pilau , with breadfruit and cocoanuts ; and with some parsley in their mouths , were sent round with the victor \\' s compliments to all his friends , just as though these presents were so many christmas turkeys . after all , i do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon queequeg . because , in the first place , he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject , unless considered from his own point of view ; and , in the second place , he did not more than one third understand me , couch my ideas simply as i would ; and , finally , he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than i did . he looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion , as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety . at last we rose and dressed ; and queequeg , taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts , so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his ramadan , we sallied out to board the pequod , sauntering along , and picking our teeth with halibut bones . chapter 18 his mark . as we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship , queequeg carrying his harpoon , captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam , saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal , and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft , unless they previously produced their papers . \" what do you mean by that , captain peleg ?\" said i , now jumping on the bulwarks , and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf . \" i mean ,\" he replied , \" he must show his papers .\" \" yes ,\" said captain bildad in his hollow voice , sticking his head from behind peleg \\' s , out of the wigwam . \" he must show that he \\' s converted . son of darkness ,\" he added , turning to queequeg , \" art thou at present in communion with any christian church ?\" \" why ,\" said i , \" he \\' s a member of the first congregational church .\" here be it said , that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches . \" first congregational church ,\" cried bildad , \" what ! that worships in deacon deuteronomy coleman \\' s meeting - house ?\" and so saying , taking out his spectacles , he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief , and putting them on very carefully , came out of the wigwam , and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks , took a good long look at queequeg . \" how long hath he been a member ?\" he then said , turning to me ; \" not very long , i rather guess , young man .\" \" no ,\" said peleg , \" and he hasn \\' t been baptized right either , or it would have washed some of that devil \\' s blue off his face .\" \" do tell , now ,\" cried bildad , \" is this philistine a regular member of deacon deuteronomy \\' s meeting ? i never saw him going there , and i pass it every lord \\' s day .\" \" i don \\' t know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeting ,\" said i ; \" all i know is , that queequeg here is a born member of the first congregational church . he is a deacon himself , queequeg is .\" \" young man ,\" said bildad sternly , \" thou art skylarking with me -- explain thyself , thou young hittite . what church dost thee mean ? answer me .\" finding myself thus hard pushed , i replied . \" i mean , sir , the same ancient catholic church to which you and i , and captain peleg there , and queequeg here , and all of us , and every mother \\' s son and soul of us belong ; the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole worshipping world ; we all belong to that ; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief ; in that we all join hands .\" \" splice , thou mean \\' st splice hands ,\" cried peleg , drawing nearer . \" young man , you \\' d better ship for a missionary , instead of a fore - mast hand ; i never heard a better sermon . deacon deuteronomy -- why father mapple himself couldn \\' t beat it , and he \\' s reckoned something . come aboard , come aboard ; never mind about the papers . i say , tell quohog there -- what \\' s that you call him ? tell quohog to step along . by the great anchor , what a harpoon he \\' s got there ! looks like good stuff that ; and he handles it about right . i say , quohog , or whatever your name is , did you ever stand in the head of a whale - boat ? did you ever strike a fish ?\" without saying a word , queequeg , in his wild sort of way , jumped upon the bulwarks , from thence into the bows of one of the whale - boats hanging to the side ; and then bracing his left knee , and poising his harpoon , cried out in some such way as this :-- \" cap \\' ain , you see him small drop tar on water dere ? you see him ? well , spose him one whale eye , well , den !\" and taking sharp aim at it , he darted the iron right over old bildad \\' s broad brim , clean across the ship \\' s decks , and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight . \" now ,\" said queequeg , quietly hauling in the line , \" spos - ee him whale - e eye ; why , dad whale dead .\" \" quick , bildad ,\" said peleg , his partner , who , aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon , had retreated towards the cabin gangway . \" quick , i say , you bildad , and get the ship \\' s papers . we must have hedgehog there , i mean quohog , in one of our boats . look ye , quohog , we \\' ll give ye the ninetieth lay , and that \\' s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of nantucket .\" so down we went into the cabin , and to my great joy queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship \\' s company to which i myself belonged . when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for signing , he turned to me and said , \" i guess , quohog there don \\' t know how to write , does he ? i say , quohog , blast ye ! dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark ? but at this question , queequeg , who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies , looked no ways abashed ; but taking the offered pen , copied upon the paper , in the proper place , an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm ; so that through captain peleg \\' s obstinate mistake touching his appellative , it stood something like this :-- quohog . his x mark . meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg , and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad - skirted drab coat , took out a bundle of tracts , and selecting one entitled \" the latter day coming ; or no time to lose ,\" placed it in queequeg \\' s hands , and then grasping them and the book with both his , looked earnestly into his eyes , and said , \" son of darkness , i must do my duty by thee ; i am part owner of this ship , and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew ; if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways , which i sadly fear , i beseech thee , remain not for aye a belial bondsman . spurn the idol bell , and the hideous dragon ; turn from the wrath to come ; mind thine eye , i say ; oh ! goodness gracious ! steer clear of the fiery pit !\" something of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildad \\' s language , heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases . \" avast there , avast there , bildad , avast now spoiling our harpooneer ,\" peleg . \" pious harpooneers never make good voyagers -- it takes the shark out of \\' em ; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish . there was young nat swaine , once the bravest boat - header out of all nantucket and the vineyard ; he joined the meeting , and never came to good . he got so frightened about his plaguy soul , that he shrinked and sheered away from whales , for fear of after - claps , in case he got stove and went to davy jones .\" \" peleg ! peleg !\" said bildad , lifting his eyes and hands , \" thou thyself , as i myself , hast seen many a perilous time ; thou knowest , peleg , what it is to have the fear of death ; how , then , can \\' st thou prate in this ungodly guise . thou beliest thine own heart , peleg . tell me , when this same pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on japan , that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab , did \\' st thou not think of death and the judgment then ?\" \" hear him , hear him now ,\" cried peleg , marching across the cabin , and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets ,--\" hear him , all of ye . think of that ! when every moment we thought the ship would sink ! death and the judgment then ? what ? with all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side ; and every sea breaking over us , fore and aft . think of death and the judgment then ? no ! no time to think about death then . life was what captain ahab and i was thinking of ; and how to save all hands -- how to rig jury - masts -- how to get into the nearest port ; that was what i was thinking of .\" bildad said no more , but buttoning up his coat , stalked on deck , where we followed him . there he stood , very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top - sail in the waist . now and then he stooped to pick up a patch , or save an end of tarred twine , which otherwise might have been wasted . chapter 19 the prophet . \" shipmates , have ye shipped in that ship ?\" queequeg and i had just left the pequod , and were sauntering away from the water , for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts , when the above words were put to us by a stranger , who , pausing before us , levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question . he was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers ; a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck . a confluent small - pox had in all directions flowed over his face , and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent , when the rushing waters have been dried up . \" have ye shipped in her ?\" he repeated . \" you mean the ship pequod , i suppose ,\" said i , trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him . \" aye , the pequod -- that ship there ,\" he said , drawing back his whole arm , and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him , with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object . \" yes ,\" said i , \" we have just signed the articles .\" \" anything down there about your souls ?\" \" about what ?\" \" oh , perhaps you hav \\' n \\' t got any ,\" he said quickly . \" no matter though , i know many chaps that hav \\' n \\' t got any ,-- good luck to \\' em ; and they are all the better off for it . a soul \\' s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon .\" \" what are you jabbering about , shipmate ?\" said i . \" he \\' s got enough , though , to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps ,\" abruptly said the stranger , placing a nervous emphasis upon the word he . \" queequeg ,\" said i , \" let \\' s go ; this fellow has broken loose from somewhere ; he \\' s talking about something and somebody we don \\' t know .\" \" stop !\" cried the stranger . \" ye said true -- ye hav \\' n \\' t seen old thunder yet , have ye ?\" \" who \\' s old thunder ?\" said i , again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner . \" captain ahab .\" \" what ! the captain of our ship , the pequod ?\" \" aye , among some of us old sailor chaps , he goes by that name . ye hav \\' n \\' t seen him yet , have ye ?\" \" no , we hav \\' n \\' t . he \\' s sick they say , but is getting better , and will be all right again before long .\" \" all right again before long !\" laughed the stranger , with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh . \" look ye ; when captain ahab is all right , then this left arm of mine will be all right ; not before .\" \" what do you know about him ?\" \" what did they tell you about him ? say that !\" \" they didn \\' t tell much of anything about him ; only i \\' ve heard that he \\' s a good whale - hunter , and a good captain to his crew .\" \" that \\' s true , that \\' s true -- yes , both true enough . but you must jump when he gives an order . step and growl ; growl and go -- that \\' s the word with captain ahab . but nothing about that thing that happened to him off cape horn , long ago , when he lay like dead for three days and nights ; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore the altar in santa ?-- heard nothing about that , eh ? nothing about the silver calabash he spat into ? and nothing about his losing his leg last voyage , according to the prophecy . didn \\' t ye hear a word about them matters and something more , eh ? no , i don \\' t think ye did ; how could ye ? who knows it ? not all nantucket , i guess . but hows \\' ever , mayhap , ye \\' ve heard tell about the leg , and how he lost it ; aye , ye have heard of that , i dare say . oh yes , that every one knows a \\' most -- i mean they know he \\' s only one leg ; and that a parmacetti took the other off .\" \" my friend ,\" said i , \" what all this gibberish of yours is about , i don \\' t know , and i don \\' t much care ; for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head . but if you are speaking of captain ahab , of that ship there , the pequod , then let me tell you , that i know all about the loss of his leg .\" \" all about it , eh -- sure you do ?-- all ?\" \" pretty sure .\" with finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod , the beggar - like stranger stood a moment , as if in a troubled reverie ; then starting a little , turned and said :--\" ye \\' ve shipped , have ye ? names down on the papers ? well , well , what \\' s signed , is signed ; and what \\' s to be , will be ; and then again , perhaps it won \\' t be , after all . anyhow , it \\' s all fixed and arranged a \\' ready ; and some sailors or other must go with him , i suppose ; as well these as any other men , god pity \\' em ! morning to ye , shipmates , morning ; the ineffable heavens bless ye ; i \\' m sorry i stopped ye .\" \" look here , friend ,\" said i , \" if you have anything important to tell us , out with it ; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us , you are mistaken in your game ; that \\' s all i have to say .\" \" and it \\' s said very well , and i like to hear a chap talk up that way ; you are just the man for him -- the likes of ye . morning to ye , shipmates , morning ! oh ! when ye get there , tell \\' em i \\' ve concluded not to make one of \\' em .\" \" ah , my dear fellow , you can \\' t fool us that way -- you can \\' t fool us . it is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him .\" \" morning to ye , shipmates , morning .\" \" morning it is ,\" said i . \" come along , queequeg , let \\' s leave this crazy man . but stop , tell me your name , will you ?\" \" elijah .\" elijah ! thought i , and we walked away , both commenting , after each other \\' s fashion , upon this ragged old sailor ; and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug , trying to be a bugbear . but we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards , when chancing to turn a corner , and looking back as i did so , who should be seen but elijah following us , though at a distance . somehow , the sight of him struck me so , that i said nothing to queequeg of his being behind , but passed on with my comrade , anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did . he did ; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us , but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine . this circumstance , coupled with his ambiguous , half - hinting , half - revealing , shrouded sort of talk , now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half - apprehensions , and all connected with the pequod ; and captain ahab ; and the leg he had lost ; and the cape horn fit ; and the silver calabash ; and what captain peleg had said of him , when i left the ship the day previous ; and the prediction of the squaw tistig ; and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail ; and a hundred other shadowy things . i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was really dogging us or not , and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg , and on that side of it retraced our steps . but elijah passed on , without seeming to notice us . this relieved me ; and once more , and finally as it seemed to me , i pronounced him in my heart , a humbug . chapter 20 all astir . a day or two passed , and there was great activity aboard the pequod . not only were the old sails being mended , but new sails were coming on board , and bolts of canvas , and coils of rigging ; in short , everything betokened that the ship \\' s preparations were hurrying to a close . captain peleg seldom or never went ashore , but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look - out upon the hands : bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores ; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after night - fall . on the day following queequeg \\' s signing the articles , word was given at all the inns where the ship \\' s company were stopping , that their chests must be on board before night , for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing . so queequeg and i got down our traps , resolving , however , to sleep ashore till the last . but it seems they always give very long notice in these cases , and the ship did not sail for several days . but no wonder ; there was a good deal to be done , and there is no telling how many things to be thought of , before the pequod was fully equipped . every one knows what a multitude of things -- beds , sauce - pans , knives and forks , shovels and tongs , napkins , nut - crackers , and what not , are indispensable to the business of housekeeping . just so with whaling , which necessitates a three - years \\' housekeeping upon the wide ocean , far from all grocers , costermongers , doctors , bakers , and bankers . and though this also holds true of merchant vessels , yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen . for besides the great length of the whaling voyage , the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery , and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented , it must be remembered , that of all ships , whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds , and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends . hence , the spare boats , spare spars , and spare lines and harpoons , and spare everythings , almost , but a spare captain and duplicate ship . at the period of our arrival at the island , the heaviest storage of the pequod had been almost completed ; comprising her beef , bread , water , fuel , and iron hoops and staves . but , as before hinted , for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things , both large and small . chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was captain bildad \\' s sister , a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit , but withal very kindhearted , who seemed resolved that , if she could help it , nothing should be found wanting in the pequod , after once fairly getting to sea . at one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward \\' s pantry ; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate \\' s desk , where he kept his log ; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one \\' s rheumatic back . never did any woman better deserve her name , which was charity -- aunt charity , as everybody called her . and like a sister of charity did this charitable aunt charity bustle about hither and thither , ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety , comfort , and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother bildad was concerned , and in which she herself owned a score or two of well - saved dollars . but it was startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming on board , as she did the last day , with a long oil - ladle in one hand , and a still longer whaling lance in the other . nor was bildad himself nor captain peleg at all backward . as for bildad , he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed , and at every fresh arrival , down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper . every once in a while peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den , roaring at the men down the hatchways , roaring up to the riggers at the mast - head , and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam . during these days of preparation , queequeg and i often visited the craft , and as often i asked about captain ahab , and how he was , and when he was going to come on board his ship . to these questions they would answer , that he was getting better and better , and was expected aboard every day ; meantime , the two captains , peleg and bildad , could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage . if i had been downright honest with myself , i would have seen very plainly in my heart that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage , without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it , so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea . but when a man suspects any wrong , it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter , he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself . and much this way it was with me . i said nothing , and tried to think nothing . at last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail . so next morning , queequeg and i took a very early start . chapter 21 going aboard . it was nearly six o \\' clock , but only grey imperfect misty dawn , when we drew nigh the wharf . \" there are some sailors running ahead there , if i see right ,\" said i to queequeg , \" it can \\' t be shadows ; she \\' s off by sunrise , i guess ; come on !\" \" avast !\" cried a voice , whose owner at the same time coming close behind us , laid a hand upon both our shoulders , and then insinuating himself between us , stood stooping forward a little , in the uncertain twilight , strangely peering from queequeg to me . it was elijah . \" going aboard ?\" \" hands off , will you ,\" said i . \" lookee here ,\" said queequeg , shaking himself , \" go \\' way !\" \" ain \\' t going aboard , then ?\" \" yes , we are ,\" said i , \" but what business is that of yours ? do you know , mr . elijah , that i consider you a little impertinent ?\" \" no , no , no ; i wasn \\' t aware of that ,\" said elijah , slowly and wonderingly looking from me to queequeg , with the most unaccountable glances . \" elijah ,\" said i , \" you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing . we are going to the indian and pacific oceans , and would prefer not to be detained .\" \" ye be , be ye ? coming back afore breakfast ?\" \" he \\' s cracked , queequeg ,\" said i , \" come on .\" \" holloa !\" cried stationary elijah , hailing us when we had removed a few paces . \" never mind him ,\" said i , \" queequeg , come on .\" but he stole up to us again , and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder , said --\" did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago ?\" struck by this plain matter - of - fact question , i answered , saying , \" yes , i thought i did see four or five men ; but it was too dim to be sure .\" \" very dim , very dim ,\" said elijah . \" morning to ye .\" once more we quitted him ; but once more he came softly after us ; and touching my shoulder again , said , \" see if you can find \\' em now , will ye ? \" find who ?\" \" morning to ye ! morning to ye !\" he rejoined , again moving off . \" oh ! i was going to warn ye against -- but never mind , never mind -- it \\' s all one , all in the family too ;-- sharp frost this morning , ain \\' t it ? good - bye to ye . shan \\' t see ye again very soon , i guess ; unless it \\' s before the grand jury .\" and with these cracked words he finally departed , leaving me , for the moment , in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence . at last , stepping on board the pequod , we found everything in profound quiet , not a soul moving . the cabin entrance was locked within ; the hatches were all on , and lumbered with coils of rigging . going forward to the forecastle , we found the slide of the scuttle open . seeing a light , we went down , and found only an old rigger there , wrapped in a tattered pea - jacket . he was thrown at whole length upon two chests , his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms . the profoundest slumber slept upon him . \" those sailors we saw , queequeg , where can they have gone to ?\" said i , looking dubiously at the sleeper . but it seemed that , when on the wharf , queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to ; hence i would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter , were it not for elijah \\' s otherwise inexplicable question . but i beat the thing down ; and again marking the sleeper , jocularly hinted to queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body ; telling him to establish himself accordingly . he put his hand upon the sleeper \\' s rear , as though feeling if it was soft enough ; and then , without more ado , sat quietly down there . \" gracious ! queequeg , don \\' t sit there ,\" said i . \" oh ! perry dood seat ,\" said queequeg , \" my country way ; won \\' t hurt him face .\" \" face !\" said i , \" call that his face ? very benevolent countenance then ; but how hard he breathes , he \\' s heaving himself ; get off , queequeg , you are heavy , it \\' s grinding the face of the poor . get off , queequeg ! look , he \\' ll twitch you off soon . i wonder he don \\' t wake .\" queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper , and lighted his tomahawk pipe . i sat at the feet . we kept the pipe passing over the sleeper , from one to the other . meanwhile , upon questioning him in his broken fashion , queequeg gave me to understand that , in his land , owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts , the king , chiefs , and great people generally , were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans ; and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect , you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows , and lay them round in the piers and alcoves . besides , it was very convenient on an excursion ; much better than those garden - chairs which are convertible into walking - sticks ; upon occasion , a chief calling his attendant , and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree , perhaps in some damp marshy place . while narrating these things , every time queequeg received the tomahawk from me , he flourished the hatchet - side of it over the sleeper \\' s head . \" what \\' s that for , queequeg ?\" \" perry easy , kill - e ; oh ! perry easy ! he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk - pipe , which , it seemed , had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul , when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger . the strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole , it began to tell upon him . he breathed with a sort of muffledness ; then seemed troubled in the nose ; then revolved over once or twice ; then sat up and rubbed his eyes . \" holloa !\" he breathed at last , \" who be ye smokers ?\" \" shipped men ,\" answered i , \" when does she sail ?\" \" aye , aye , ye are going in her , be ye ? she sails to - day . the captain came aboard last night .\" \" what captain ?-- ahab ?\" \" who but him indeed ?\" i was going to ask him some further questions concerning ahab , when we heard a noise on deck . \" holloa ! starbuck \\' s astir ,\" said the rigger . \" he \\' s a lively chief mate , that ; good man , and a pious ; but all alive now , i must turn to .\" and so saying he went on deck , and we followed . it was now clear sunrise . soon the crew came on board in twos and threes ; the riggers bestirred themselves ; the mates were actively engaged ; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board . meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin . chapter 22 merry christmas . at length , towards noon , upon the final dismissal of the ship \\' s riggers , and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf , and after the ever - thoughtful charity had come off in a whale - boat , with her last gift -- a night - cap for stubb , the second mate , her brother - in - law , and a spare bible for the steward -- after all this , the two captains , peleg and bildad , issued from the cabin , and turning to the chief mate , peleg said : \" now , mr . starbuck , are you sure everything is right ? captain ahab is all ready -- just spoke to him -- nothing more to be got from shore , eh ? well , call all hands , then . muster \\' em aft here -- blast \\' em !\" \" no need of profane words , however great the hurry , peleg ,\" said bildad , \" but away with thee , friend starbuck , and do our bidding .\" how now ! here upon the very point of starting for the voyage , captain peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter - deck , just as if they were to be joint - commanders at sea , as well as to all appearances in port . and , as for captain ahab , no sign of him was yet to be seen ; only , they said he was in the cabin . but then , the idea was , that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh , and steering her well out to sea . indeed , as that was not at all his proper business , but the pilot \\' s ; and as he was not yet completely recovered -- so they said -- therefore , captain ahab stayed below . and all this seemed natural enough ; especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor , but remain over the cabin table , having a farewell merry - making with their shore friends , before they quit the ship for good with the pilot . but there was not much chance to think over the matter , for captain peleg was now all alive . he seemed to do most of the talking and commanding , and not bildad . \" aft here , ye sons of bachelors ,\" he cried , as the sailors lingered at the main - mast . \" mr . starbuck , drive \\' em aft .\" \" strike the tent there !\"-- was the next order . as i hinted before , this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port ; and on board the pequod , for thirty years , the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor . \" man the capstan ! blood and thunder !-- jump !\"-- was the next command , and the crew sprang for the handspikes . now in getting under weigh , the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship . and here bildad , who , with peleg , be it known , in addition to his other officers , was one of the licensed pilots of the port -- he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the nantucket pilot - fee to all the ships he was concerned in , for he never piloted any other craft -- bildad , i say , might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor , and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody , to cheer the hands at the windlass , who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley , with hearty good will . nevertheless , not three days previous , bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod , particularly in getting under weigh ; and charity , his sister , had placed a small choice copy of watts in each seaman \\' s berth . meantime , overseeing the other part of the ship , captain peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner . i almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up ; involuntarily i paused on my handspike , and told queequeg to do the same , thinking of the perils we both ran , in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot . i was comforting myself , however , with the thought that in pious bildad might be found some salvation , spite of his seven hundred and seventy - seventh lay ; when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear , and turning round , was horrified at the apparition of captain peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity . that was my first kick . \" is that the way they heave in the marchant service ?\" he roared . \" spring , thou sheep - head ; spring , and break thy backbone ! why don \\' t ye spring , i say , all of ye -- spring ! quohog ! spring , thou chap with the red whiskers ; spring there , scotch - cap ; spring , thou green pants . spring , i say , all of ye , and spring your eyes out !\" and so saying , he moved along the windlass , here and there using his leg very freely , while imperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody . thinks i , captain peleg must have been drinking something to - day . at last the anchor was up , the sails were set , and off we glided . it was a short , cold christmas ; and as the short northern day merged into night , we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean , whose freezing spray cased us in ice , as in polished armor . the long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight ; and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant , vast curving icicles depended from the bows . lank bildad , as pilot , headed the first watch , and ever and anon , as the old craft deep dived into the green seas , and sent the shivering frost all over her , and the winds howled , and the cordage rang , his steady notes were heard ,-- \" sweet fields beyond the swelling flood , stand dressed in living green . so to the jews old canaan stood , while jordan rolled between .\" never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then . they were full of hope and fruition . spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous atlantic , spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket , there was yet , it then seemed to me , many a pleasant haven in store ; and meads and glades so eternally vernal , that the grass shot up by the spring , untrodden , unwilted , remains at midsummer . at last we gained such an offing , that the two pilots were needed no longer . the stout sail - boat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside . it was curious and not unpleasing , how peleg and bildad were affected at this juncture , especially captain bildad . for loath to depart , yet ; very loath to leave , for good , a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage -- beyond both stormy capes ; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested ; a ship , in which an old shipmate sailed as captain ; a man almost as old as he , once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw ; loath to say good - bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him ,-- poor old bildad lingered long ; paced the deck with anxious strides ; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there ; again came on deck , and looked to windward ; looked towards the wide and endless waters , only bounded by the far - off unseen eastern continents ; looked towards the land ; looked aloft ; looked right and left ; looked everywhere and nowhere ; and at last , mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin , convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand , and holding up a lantern , for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face , as much as to say , \" nevertheless , friend peleg , i can stand it ; yes , i can .\" as for peleg himself , he took it more like a philosopher ; but for all his philosophy , there was a tear twinkling in his eye , when the lantern came too near . and he , too , did not a little run from cabin to deck -- now a word below , and now a word with starbuck , the chief mate . but , at last , he turned to his comrade , with a final sort of look about him ,--\" captain bildad -- come , old shipmate , we must go . back the main - yard there ! boat ahoy ! stand by to come close alongside , now ! careful , careful !-- come , bildad , boy -- say your last . luck to ye , starbuck -- luck to ye , mr . stubb -- luck to ye , mr . flask -- good - bye and good luck to ye all -- and this day three years i \\' ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old nantucket . hurrah and away !\" \" god bless ye , and have ye in his holy keeping , men ,\" murmured old bildad , almost incoherently . \" i hope ye \\' ll have fine weather now , so that captain ahab may soon be moving among ye -- a pleasant sun is all he needs , and ye \\' ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go . be careful in the hunt , ye mates . don \\' t stave the boats needlessly , ye harpooneers ; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent . within the year . don \\' t forget your prayers , either . mr . starbuck , mind that cooper don \\' t waste the spare staves . oh ! the sail - needles are in the green locker ! don \\' t whale it too much a \\' lord \\' s days , men ; but don \\' t miss a fair chance either , that \\' s rejecting heaven \\' s good gifts . have an eye to the molasses tierce , mr . stubb ; it was a little leaky , i thought . if ye touch at the islands , mr . flask , beware of fornication . good - bye , good - bye ! don \\' t keep that cheese too long down in the hold , mr . starbuck ; it \\' ll spoil . be careful with the butter -- twenty cents the pound it was , and mind ye , if --\" \" come , come , captain bildad ; stop palavering ,-- away !\" and with that , peleg hurried him over the side , and both dropt into the boat . ship and boat diverged ; the cold , damp night breeze blew between ; a screaming gull flew overhead ; the two hulls wildly rolled ; we gave three heavy - hearted cheers , and blindly plunged like fate into the lone atlantic . chapter 23 the lee shore . some chapters back , one bulkington was spoken of , a tall , newlanded mariner , encountered in new bedford at the inn . when on that shivering winter \\' s night , the pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves , who should i see standing at her helm but bulkington ! i looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man , who in mid - winter just landed from a four years \\' dangerous voyage , could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term . the land seemed scorching to his feet . wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable ; deep memories yield no epitaphs ; this six - inch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington . let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm - tossed ship , that miserably drives along the leeward land . the port would fain give succor ; the port is pitiful ; in the port is safety , comfort , hearthstone , supper , warm blankets , friends , all that \\' s kind to our mortalities . but in that gale , the port , the land , is that ship \\' s direst jeopardy ; she must fly all hospitality ; one touch of land , though it but graze the keel , would make her shudder through and through . with all her might she crowds all sail off shore ; in so doing , fights \\' gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward ; seeks all the lashed sea \\' s landlessness again ; for refuge \\' s sake forlornly rushing into peril ; her only friend her bitterest foe ! know ye now , bulkington ? glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth ; that all deep , earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea ; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous , slavish shore ? but as in landlessness alone resides highest truth , shoreless , indefinite as god -- so , better is it to perish in that howling infinite , than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee , even if that were safety ! for worm - like , then , oh ! who would craven crawl to land ! terrors of the terrible ! is all this agony so vain ? take heart , take heart , o bulkington ! bear thee grimly , demigod ! up from the spray of thy ocean - perishing -- straight up , leaps thy apotheosis ! chapter 24 the advocate . as queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling ; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit ; therefore , i am all anxiety to convince ye , ye landsmen , of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales . in the first place , it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact , that among people at large , the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions . if a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society , it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits , were he presented to the company as a harpooneer , say ; and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials s . w . f . ( sperm whale fishery ) to his visiting card , such a procedure would be deemed pre - eminently presuming and ridiculous . doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us whalemen , is this : they think that , at best , our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business ; and that when actively engaged therein , we are surrounded by all manner of defilements . butchers we are , that is true . but butchers , also , and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honour . and as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business , ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown , and which , upon the whole , will triumphantly plant the sperm whale - ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth . but even granting the charge in question to be true ; what disordered slippery decks of a whale - ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle - fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies \\' plaudits ? and if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier \\' s profession ; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery , would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale \\' s vast tail , fanning into eddies the air over his head . for what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of god ! but , though the world scouts at us whale hunters , yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage ; yea , an all - abounding adoration ! for almost all the tapers , lamps , and candles that burn round the globe , burn , as before so many shrines , to our glory ! but look at this matter in other lights ; weigh it in all sorts of scales ; see what we whalemen are , and have been . why did the dutch in de witt \\' s time have admirals of their whaling fleets ? why did louis xvi . of france , at his own personal expense , fit out whaling ships from dunkirk , and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of nantucket ? why did britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of l1 , 000 , 000 ? and lastly , how comes it that we whalemen of america now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world ; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels ; manned by eighteen thousand men ; yearly consuming 4 , 000 , 000 of dollars ; the ships worth , at the time of sailing , $ 20 , 000 , 000 ! and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $ 7 , 000 , 000 . how comes all this , if there be not something puissant in whaling ? but this is not the half ; look again . i freely assert , that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot , for his life , point out one single peaceful influence , which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world , taken in one aggregate , than the high and mighty business of whaling . one way and another , it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves , and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues , that whaling may well be regarded as that egyptian mother , who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb . it would be a hopeless , endless task to catalogue all these things . let a handful suffice . for many years past the whale - ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth . she has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart , where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed . if american and european men - of - war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors , let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the whale - ship , which originally showed them the way , and first interpreted between them and the savages . they may celebrate as they will the heroes of exploring expeditions , your cooks , your krusensterns ; but i say that scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of nantucket , that were as great , and greater than your cook and your krusenstern . for in their succourless empty - handedness , they , in the heathenish sharked waters , and by the beaches of unrecorded , javelin islands , battled with virgin wonders and terrors that cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared . all that is made such a flourish of in the old south sea voyages , those things were but the life - time commonplaces of our heroic nantucketers . often , adventures which vancouver dedicates three chapters to , these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship \\' s common log . ah , the world ! oh , the world ! until the whale fishery rounded cape horn , no commerce but colonial , scarcely any intercourse but colonial , was carried on between europe and the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacific coast . it was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the spanish crown , touching those colonies ; and , if space permitted , it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of peru , chili , and bolivia from the yoke of old spain , and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts . that great america on the other side of the sphere , australia , was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman . after its first blunder - born discovery by a dutchman , all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous ; but the whale - ship touched there . the whale - ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony . moreover , in the infancy of the first australian settlement , the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale - ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters . the uncounted isles of all polynesia confess the same truth , and do commercial homage to the whale - ship , that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant , and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations . if that double - bolted land , japan , is ever to become hospitable , it is the whale - ship alone to whom the credit will be due ; for already she is on the threshold . but if , in the face of all this , you still declare that whaling has no aesthetically noble associations connected with it , then am i ready to shiver fifty lances with you there , and unhorse you with a split helmet every time . the whale has no famous author , and whaling no famous chronicler , you will say . the whale no famous author , and whaling no famous chronicler ? who wrote the first account of our leviathan ? who but mighty job ! and who composed the first narrative of a whaling - voyage ? who , but no less a prince than alfred the great , who , with his own royal pen , took down the words from other , the norwegian whale - hunter of those times ! and who pronounced our glowing eulogy in parliament ? who , but edmund burke ! true enough , but then whalemen themselves are poor devils ; they have no good blood in their veins . no good blood in their veins ? they have something better than royal blood there . the grandmother of benjamin franklin was mary morrel ; afterwards , by marriage , mary folger , one of the old settlers of nantucket , and the ancestress to a long line of folgers and harpooneers -- all kith and kin to noble benjamin -- this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other . good again ; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable . whaling not respectable ? whaling is imperial ! by old english statutory law , the whale is declared \" a royal fish .\"* oh , that \\' s only nominal ! the whale himself has never figured in any grand imposing way . the whale never figured in any grand imposing way ? in one of the mighty triumphs given to a roman general upon his entering the world \\' s capital , the bones of a whale , brought all the way from the syrian coast , were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession .* * see subsequent chapters for something more on this head . grant it , since you cite it ; but , say what you will , there is no real dignity in whaling . no dignity in whaling ? the dignity of our calling the very heavens attest . cetus is a constellation in the south ! no more ! drive down your hat in presence of the czar , and take it off to queequeg ! no more ! i know a man that , in his lifetime , has taken three hundred and fifty whales . i account that man more honourable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns . and , as for me , if , by any possibility , there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing in me ; if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of ; if hereafter i shall do anything that , upon the whole , a man might rather have done than to have left undone ; if , at my death , my executors , or more properly my creditors , find any precious mss . in my desk , then here i prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling ; for a whale - ship was my yale college and my harvard . chapter 25 postscript . in behalf of the dignity of whaling , i would fain advance naught but substantiated facts . but after embattling his facts , an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise , which might tell eloquently upon his cause -- such an advocate , would he not be blameworthy ? it is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens , even modern ones , a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through . there is a saltcellar of state , so called , and there may be a castor of state . how they use the salt , precisely -- who knows ? certain i am , however , that a king \\' s head is solemnly oiled at his coronation , even as a head of salad . can it be , though , that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well , as they anoint machinery ? much might be ruminated here , concerning the essential dignity of this regal process , because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair , and palpably smells of that anointing . in truth , a mature man who uses hair - oil , unless medicinally , that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere . as a general rule , he can \\' t amount to much in his totality . but the only thing to be considered here , is this -- what kind of oil is used at coronations ? certainly it cannot be olive oil , nor macassar oil , nor castor oil , nor bear \\' s oil , nor train oil , nor cod - liver oil . what then can it possibly be , but sperm oil in its unmanufactured , unpolluted state , the sweetest of all oils ? think of that , ye loyal britons ! we whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff ! chapter 26 knights and squires . the chief mate of the pequod was starbuck , a native of nantucket , and a quaker by descent . he was a long , earnest man , and though born on an icy coast , seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes , his flesh being hard as twice - baked biscuit . transported to the indies , his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale . he must have been born in some time of general drought and famine , or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous . only some thirty arid summers had he seen ; those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness . but this , his thinness , so to speak , seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares , than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight . it was merely the condensation of the man . he was by no means ill - looking ; quite the contrary . his pure tight skin was an excellent fit ; and closely wrapped up in it , and embalmed with inner health and strength , like a revivified egyptian , this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come , and to endure always , as now ; for be it polar snow or torrid sun , like a patent chronometer , his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates . looking into his eyes , you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand - fold perils he had calmly confronted through life . a staid , steadfast man , whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action , and not a tame chapter of sounds . yet , for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude , there were certain qualities in him which at times affected , and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest . uncommonly conscientious for a seaman , and endued with a deep natural reverence , the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition ; but to that sort of superstition , which in some organizations seems rather to spring , somehow , from intelligence than from ignorance . outward portents and inward presentiments were his . and if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul , much more did his far - away domestic memories of his young cape wife and child , tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature , and open him still further to those latent influences which , in some honest - hearted men , restrain the gush of dare - devil daring , so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery . \" i will have no man in my boat ,\" said starbuck , \" who is not afraid of a whale .\" by this , he seemed to mean , not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril , but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward . \" aye , aye ,\" said stubb , the second mate , \" starbuck , there , is as careful a man as you \\' ll find anywhere in this fishery .\" but we shall ere long see what that word \" careful \" precisely means when used by a man like stubb , or almost any other whale hunter . starbuck was no crusader after perils ; in him courage was not a sentiment ; but a thing simply useful to him , and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions . besides , he thought , perhaps , that in this business of whaling , courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship , like her beef and her bread , and not to be foolishly wasted . wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun - down ; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him . for , thought starbuck , i am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living , and not to be killed by them for theirs ; and that hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew . what doom was his own father \\' s ? where , in the bottomless deeps , could he find the torn limbs of his brother ? with memories like these in him , and , moreover , given to a certain superstitiousness , as has been said ; the courage of this starbuck which could , nevertheless , still flourish , must indeed have been extreme . but it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized , and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had ; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him , which , under suitable circumstances , would break out from its confinement , and burn all his courage up . and brave as he might be , it was that sort of bravery chiefly , visible in some intrepid men , which , while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas , or winds , or whales , or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world , yet cannot withstand those more terrific , because more spiritual terrors , which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man . but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance , the complete abasement of poor starbuck \\' s fortitude , scarce might i have the heart to write it ; for it is a thing most sorrowful , nay shocking , to expose the fall of valour in the soul . men may seem detestable as joint stock - companies and nations ; knaves , fools , and murderers there may be ; men may have mean and meagre faces ; but man , in the ideal , is so noble and so sparkling , such a grand and glowing creature , that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes . that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves , so far within us , that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone ; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor - ruined man . nor can piety itself , at such a shameful sight , completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars . but this august dignity i treat of , is not the dignity of kings and robes , but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture . thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike ; that democratic dignity which , on all hands , radiates without end from god ; himself ! the great god absolute ! the centre and circumference of all democracy ! his omnipresence , our divine equality ! if , then , to meanest mariners , and renegades and castaways , i shall hereafter ascribe high qualities , though dark ; weave round them tragic graces ; if even the most mournful , perchance the most abased , among them all , shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts ; if i shall touch that workman \\' s arm with some ethereal light ; if i shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun ; then against all mortal critics bear me out in it , thou just spirit of equality , which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind ! bear me out in it , thou great democratic god ! who didst not refuse to the swart convict , bunyan , the pale , poetic pearl ; thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold , the stumped and paupered arm of old cervantes ; thou who didst pick up andrew jackson from the pebbles ; who didst hurl him upon a war - horse ; who didst thunder him higher than a throne ! thou who , in all thy mighty , earthly marchings , ever cullest thy selectest champions from the kingly commons ; bear me out in it , o god ! chapter 27 knights and squires . stubb was the second mate . he was a native of cape cod ; and hence , according to local usage , was called a cape - cod - man . a happy - go - lucky ; neither craven nor valiant ; taking perils as they came with an indifferent air ; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase , toiling away , calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year . good - humored , easy , and careless , he presided over his whale - boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner , and his crew all invited guests . he was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat , as an old stage - driver is about the snugness of his box . when close to the whale , in the very death - lock of the fight , he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off - handedly , as a whistling tinker his hammer . he would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster . long usage had , for this stubb , converted the jaws of death into an easy chair . what he thought of death itself , there is no telling . whether he ever thought of it at all , might be a question ; but , if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner , no doubt , like a good sailor , he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft , and bestir themselves there , about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order , and not sooner . what , perhaps , with other things , made stubb such an easy - going , unfearing man , so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlars , all bowed to the ground with their packs ; what helped to bring about that almost impious good - humor of his ; that thing must have been his pipe . for , like his nose , his short , black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face . you would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe . he kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded , stuck in a rack , within easy reach of his hand ; and , whenever he turned in , he smoked them all out in succession , lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter ; then loading them again to be in readiness anew . for , when stubb dressed , instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers , he put his pipe into his mouth . i say this continual smoking must have been one cause , at least , of his peculiar disposition ; for every one knows that this earthly air , whether ashore or afloat , is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it ; and as in time of the cholera , some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths ; so , likewise , against all mortal tribulations , stubb \\' s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent . the third mate was flask , a native of tisbury , in martha \\' s vineyard . a short , stout , ruddy young fellow , very pugnacious concerning whales , who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him ; and therefore it was a sort of point of honour with him , to destroy them whenever encountered . so utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways ; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them ; that in his poor opinion , the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse , or at least water - rat , requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil . this ignorant , unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales ; he followed these fish for the fun of it ; and a three years \\' voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time . as a carpenter \\' s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails ; so mankind may be similarly divided . little flask was one of the wrought ones ; made to clinch tight and last long . they called him king - post on board of the pequod ; because , in form , he could be well likened to the short , square timber known by that name in arctic whalers ; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it , serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas . now these three mates -- starbuck , stubb , and flask , were momentous men . they it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the pequod \\' s boats as headsmen . in that grand order of battle in which captain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales , these three headsmen were as captains of companies . or , being armed with their long keen whaling spears , they were as a picked trio of lancers ; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins . and since in this famous fishery , each mate or headsman , like a gothic knight of old , is always accompanied by his boat - steerer or harpooneer , who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance , when the former one has been badly twisted , or elbowed in the assault ; and moreover , as there generally subsists between the two , a close intimacy and friendliness ; it is therefore but meet , that in this place we set down who the pequod \\' s harpooneers were , and to what headsman each of them belonged . first of all was queequeg , whom starbuck , the chief mate , had selected for his squire . but queequeg is already known . next was tashtego , an unmixed indian from gay head , the most westerly promontory of martha \\' s vineyard , where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men , which has long supplied the neighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers . in the fishery , they usually go by the generic name of gay - headers . tashtego \\' s long , lean , sable hair , his high cheek bones , and black rounding eyes -- for an indian , oriental in their largeness , but antarctic in their glittering expression -- all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters , who , in quest of the great new england moose , had scoured , bow in hand , the aboriginal forests of the main . but no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland , tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea ; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires . to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs , you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier puritans , and half - believed this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powers of the air . tashtego was stubb the second mate \\' s squire . third among the harpooneers was daggoo , a gigantic , coal - black negro - savage , with a lion - like tread -- an ahasuerus to behold . suspended from his ears were two golden hoops , so large that the sailors called them ring - bolts , and would talk of securing the top - sail halyards to them . in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler , lying in a lonely bay on his native coast . and never having been anywhere in the world but in africa , nantucket , and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen ; and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped ; daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues , and erect as a giraffe , moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks . there was a corporeal humility in looking up at him ; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress . curious to tell , this imperial negro , ahasuerus daggoo , was the squire of little flask , who looked like a chess - man beside him . as for the residue of the pequod \\' s company , be it said , that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the american whale fishery , are americans born , though pretty nearly all the officers are . herein it is the same with the american whale fishery as with the american army and military and merchant navies , and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the american canals and railroads . the same , i say , because in all these cases the native american liberally provides the brains , the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles . no small number of these whaling seamen belong to the azores , where the outward bound nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores . in like manner , the greenland whalers sailing out of hull or london , put in at the shetland islands , to receive the full complement of their crew . upon the passage homewards , they drop them there again . how it is , there is no telling , but islanders seem to make the best whalemen . they were nearly all islanders in the pequod , isolatoes too , i call such , not acknowledging the common continent of men , but each isolato living on a separate continent of his own . yet now , federated along one keel , what a set these isolatoes were ! an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea , and all the ends of the earth , accompanying old ahab in the pequod to lay the world \\' s grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back . black little pip -- he never did -- oh , no ! he went before . poor alabama boy ! on the grim pequod \\' s forecastle , ye shall ere long see him , beating his tambourine ; prelusive of the eternal time , when sent for , to the great quarter - deck on high , he was bid strike in with angels , and beat his tambourine in glory ; called a coward here , hailed a hero there ! chapter 28 ahab . for several days after leaving nantucket , nothing above hatches was seen of captain ahab . the mates regularly relieved each other at the watches , and for aught that could be seen to the contrary , they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship ; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory , that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously . yes , their supreme lord and dictator was there , though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin . every time i ascended to the deck from my watches below , i instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible ; for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain , now in the seclusion of the sea , became almost a perturbation . this was strangely heightened at times by the ragged elijah \\' s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me , with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived of . but poorly could i withstand them , much as in other moods i was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves . but whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness -- to call it so -- which i felt , yet whenever i came to look about me in the ship , it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions . for though the harpooneers , with the great body of the crew , were a far more barbaric , heathenish , and motley set than any of the tame merchant - ship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with , still i ascribed this -- and rightly ascribed it -- to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation in which i had so abandonedly embarked . but it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship , the mates , which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings , and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage . three better , more likely sea - officers and men , each in his own different way , could not readily be found , and they were every one of them americans ; a nantucketer , a vineyarder , a cape man . now , it being christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor , for a space we had biting polar weather , though all the time running away from it to the southward ; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed , gradually leaving that merciless winter , and all its intolerable weather behind us . it was one of those less lowering , but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition , when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity , that as i mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch , so soon as i levelled my glance towards the taffrail , foreboding shivers ran over me . reality outran apprehension ; captain ahab stood upon his quarter - deck . there seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him , nor of the recovery from any . he looked like a man cut away from the stake , when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them , or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness . his whole high , broad form , seemed made of solid bronze , and shaped in an unalterable mould , like cellini \\' s cast perseus . threading its way out from among his grey hairs , and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck , till it disappeared in his clothing , you saw a slender rod - like mark , lividly whitish . it resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight , lofty trunk of a great tree , when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it , and without wrenching a single twig , peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom , ere running off into the soil , leaving the tree still greenly alive , but branded . whether that mark was born with him , or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound , no one could certainly say . by some tacit consent , throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it , especially by the mates . but once tashtego \\' s senior , an old gay - head indian among the crew , superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did ahab become that way branded , and then it came upon him , not in the fury of any mortal fray , but in an elemental strife at sea . yet , this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived , by what a grey manxman insinuated , an old sepulchral man , who , having never before sailed out of nantucket , had never ere this laid eye upon wild ahab . nevertheless , the old sea - traditions , the immemorial credulities , popularly invested this old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment . so that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever captain ahab should be tranquilly laid out -- which might hardly come to pass , so he muttered -- then , whoever should do that last office for the dead , would find a birth - mark on him from crown to sole . so powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me , and the livid brand which streaked it , that for the first few moments i hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood . it had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale \\' s jaw . \" aye , he was dismasted off japan ,\" said the old gay - head indian once ; \" but like his dismasted craft , he shipped another mast without coming home for it . he has a quiver of \\' em .\" i was struck with the singular posture he maintained . upon each side of the pequod \\' s quarter deck , and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds , there was an auger hole , bored about half an inch or so , into the plank . his bone leg steadied in that hole ; one arm elevated , and holding by a shroud ; captain ahab stood erect , looking straight out beyond the ship \\' s ever - pitching prow . there was an infinity of firmest fortitude , a determinate , unsurrenderable wilfulness , in the fixed and fearless , forward dedication of that glance . not a word he spoke ; nor did his officers say aught to him ; though by all their minutest gestures and expressions , they plainly showed the uneasy , if not painful , consciousness of being under a troubled master - eye . and not only that , but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face ; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe . ere long , from his first visit in the air , he withdrew into his cabin . but after that morning , he was every day visible to the crew ; either standing in his pivot - hole , or seated upon an ivory stool he had ; or heavily walking the deck . as the sky grew less gloomy ; indeed , began to grow a little genial , he became still less and less a recluse ; as if , when the ship had sailed from home , nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded . and , by and by , it came to pass , that he was almost continually in the air ; but , as yet , for all that he said , or perceptibly did , on the at last sunny deck , he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast . but the pequod was only making a passage now ; not regularly cruising ; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to , so that there was little or nothing , out of himself , to employ or excite ahab , now ; and thus chase away , for that one interval , the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow , as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon . nevertheless , ere long , the warm , warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant , holiday weather we came to , seemed gradually to charm him from his mood . for , as when the red - cheeked , dancing girls , april and may , trip home to the wintry , misanthropic woods ; even the barest , ruggedest , most thunder - cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts , to welcome such glad - hearted visitants ; so ahab did , in the end , a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air . more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look , which , in any other man , would have soon flowered out in a smile . chapter 29 enter ahab ; to him , stubb . some days elapsed , and ice and icebergs all astern , the pequod now went rolling through the bright quito spring , which , at sea , almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic . the warmly cool , clear , ringing , perfumed , overflowing , redundant days , were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet , heaped up -- flaked up , with rose - water snow . the starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets , nursing at home in lonely pride , the memory of their absent conquering earls , the golden helmeted suns ! for sleeping man , \\' twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights . but all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world . inward they turned upon the soul , especially when the still mild hours of eve came on ; then , memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights . and all these subtle agencies , more and more they wrought on ahab \\' s texture . old age is always wakeful ; as if , the longer linked with life , the less man has to do with aught that looks like death . among sea - commanders , the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night - cloaked deck . it was so with ahab ; only that now , of late , he seemed so much to live in the open air , that truly speaking , his visits were more to the cabin , than from the cabin to the planks . \" it feels like going down into one \\' s tomb ,\"-- he would mutter to himself --\" for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle , to go to my grave - dug berth .\" so , almost every twenty - four hours , when the watches of the night were set , and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below ; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle , the sailors flung it not rudely down , as by day , but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates ; when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail , habitually , the silent steersman would watch the cabin - scuttle ; and ere long the old man would emerge , gripping at the iron banister , to help his crippled way . some considering touch of humanity was in him ; for at times like these , he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter - deck ; because to his wearied mates , seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel , such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step , that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks . but once , the mood was on him too deep for common regardings ; and as with heavy , lumber - like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast , stubb , the old second mate , came up from below , with a certain unassured , deprecating humorousness , hinted that if captain ahab was pleased to walk the planks , then , no one could say nay ; but there might be some way of muffling the noise ; hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow , and the insertion into it , of the ivory heel . ah ! stubb , thou didst not know ahab then . \" am i a cannon - ball , stubb ,\" said ahab , \" that thou wouldst wad me that fashion ? but go thy ways ; i had forgot . below to thy nightly grave ; where such as ye sleep between shrouds , to use ye to the filling one at last .-- down , dog , and kennel !\" starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man , stubb was speechless a moment ; then said excitedly , \" i am not used to be spoken to that way , sir ; i do but less than half like it , sir .\" \" avast ! gritted ahab between his set teeth , and violently moving away , as if to avoid some passionate temptation . \" no , sir ; not yet ,\" said stubb , emboldened , \" i will not tamely be called a dog , sir .\" \" then be called ten times a donkey , and a mule , and an ass , and begone , or i \\' ll clear the world of thee !\" as he said this , ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect , that stubb involuntarily retreated . \" i was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it ,\" muttered stubb , as he found himself descending the cabin - scuttle . \" it \\' s very queer . stop , stubb ; somehow , now , i don \\' t well know whether to go back and strike him , or -- what \\' s that ?-- down here on my knees and pray for him ? yes , that was the thought coming up in me ; but it would be the first time i ever did pray . it \\' s queer ; very queer ; and he \\' s queer too ; aye , take him fore and aft , he \\' s about the queerest old man stubb ever sailed with . how he flashed at me !-- his eyes like powder - pans ! is he mad ? anyway there \\' s something on his mind , as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks . he aint in his bed now , either , more than three hours out of the twenty - four ; and he don \\' t sleep then . didn \\' t that dough - boy , the steward , tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man \\' s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled , and the sheets down at the foot , and the coverlid almost tied into knots , and the pillow a sort of frightful hot , as though a baked brick had been on it ? a hot old man ! i guess he \\' s got what some folks ashore call a conscience ; it \\' s a kind of tic - dolly - row they say -- worse nor a toothache . well , well ; i don \\' t know what it is , but the lord keep me from catching it . he \\' s full of riddles ; i wonder what he goes into the after hold for , every night , as dough - boy tells me he suspects ; what \\' s that for , i should like to know ? who \\' s made appointments with him in the hold ? ain \\' t that queer , now ? but there \\' s no telling , it \\' s the old game -- here goes for a snooze . damn me , it \\' s worth a fellow \\' s while to be born into the world , if only to fall right asleep . and now that i think of it , that \\' s about the first thing babies do , and that \\' s a sort of queer , too . damn me , but all things are queer , come to think of \\' em . but that \\' s against my principles . think not , is my eleventh commandment ; and sleep when you can , is my twelfth -- so here goes again . but how \\' s that ? didn \\' t he call me a dog ? blazes ! he called me ten times a donkey , and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that ! he might as well have kicked me , and done with it . maybe he did kick me , and i didn \\' t observe it , i was so taken all aback with his brow , somehow . it flashed like a bleached bone . what the devil \\' s the matter with me ? i don \\' t stand right on my legs . coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out . by the lord , i must have been dreaming , though -- how ? how ? how ?-- but the only way \\' s to stash it ; so here goes to hammock again ; and in the morning , i \\' ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight .\" chapter 30 the pipe . when stubb had departed , ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks ; and then , as had been usual with him of late , calling a sailor of the watch , he sent him below for his ivory stool , and also his pipe . lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck , he sat and smoked . in old norse times , the thrones of the sea - loving danish kings were fabricated , saith tradition , of the tusks of the narwhale . how could one look at ahab then , seated on that tripod of bones , without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized ? for a khan of the plank , and a king of the sea , and a great lord of leviathans was ahab . some moments passed , during which the thick vapour came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs , which blew back again into his face . \" how now ,\" he soliloquized at last , withdrawing the tube , \" this smoking no longer soothes . oh , my pipe ! hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone ! here have i been unconsciously toiling , not pleasuring -- aye , and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while ; to windward , and with such nervous whiffs , as if , like the dying whale , my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble . what business have i with this pipe ? this thing that is meant for sereneness , to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs , not among torn iron - grey locks like mine . i \\' ll smoke no more --\" he tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea . the fire hissed in the waves ; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made . with slouched hat , ahab lurchingly paced the planks . chapter 31 queen mab . next morning stubb accosted flask . \" such a queer dream , king - post , i never had . you know the old man \\' s ivory leg , well i dreamed he kicked me with it ; and when i tried to kick back , upon my soul , my little man , i kicked my leg right off ! and then , presto ! ahab seemed a pyramid , and i , like a blazing fool , kept kicking at it . but what was still more curious , flask -- you know how curious all dreams are -- through all this rage that i was in , i somehow seemed to be thinking to myself , that after all , it was not much of an insult , that kick from ahab . \\' why ,\\' thinks i , \\' what \\' s the row ? it \\' s not a real leg , only a false leg .\\' and there \\' s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump . that \\' s what makes a blow from the hand , flask , fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane . the living member -- that makes the living insult , my little man . and thinks i to myself all the while , mind , while i was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid -- so confoundedly contradictory was it all , all the while , i say , i was thinking to myself , \\' what \\' s his leg now , but a cane -- a whalebone cane . yes ,\\' thinks i , \\' it was only a playful cudgelling -- in fact , only a whaleboning that he gave me -- not a base kick . besides ,\\' thinks i , \\' look at it once ; why , the end of it -- the foot part -- what a small sort of end it is ; whereas , if a broad footed farmer kicked me , there \\' s a devilish broad insult . but this insult is whittled down to a point only .\\' but now comes the greatest joke of the dream , flask . while i was battering away at the pyramid , a sort of badger - haired old merman , with a hump on his back , takes me by the shoulders , and slews me round . \\' what are you \\' bout ?\\' says he . slid ! man , but i was frightened . such a phiz ! but , somehow , next moment i was over the fright . \\' what am i about ?\\' says i at last . \\' and what business is that of yours , i should like to know , mr . humpback ? do you want a kick ?\\' by the lord , flask , i had no sooner said that , than he turned round his stern to me , bent over , and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout -- what do you think , i saw ?-- why thunder alive , man , his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes , with the points out . says i , on second thoughts , \\' i guess i won \\' t kick you , old fellow .\\' \\' wise stubb ,\\' said he , \\' wise stubb ;\\' and kept muttering it all the time , a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag . seeing he wasn \\' t going to stop saying over his \\' wise stubb , wise stubb ,\\' i thought i might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again . but i had only just lifted my foot for it , when he roared out , \\' stop that kicking !\\' \\' halloa ,\\' says i , \\' what \\' s the matter now , old fellow ?\\' \\' look ye here ,\\' says he ; \\' let \\' s argue the insult . captain ahab kicked ye , didn \\' t he ?\\' \\' yes , he did ,\\' says i --\\' right here it was .\\' \\' very good ,\\' says he --\\' he used his ivory leg , didn \\' t he ?\\' \\' yes , he did ,\\' says i . \\' well then ,\\' says he , \\' wise stubb , what have you to complain of ? didn \\' t he kick with right good will ? it wasn \\' t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with , was it ? no , you were kicked by a great man , and with a beautiful ivory leg , stubb . it \\' s an honour ; i consider it an honour . listen , wise stubb . in old england the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen , and made garter - knights of ; but , be your boast , stubb , that ye were kicked by old ahab , and made a wise man of . remember what i say ; be kicked by him ; account his kicks honours ; and on no account kick back ; for you can \\' t help yourself , wise stubb . don \\' t you see that pyramid ?\\' with that , he all of a sudden seemed somehow , in some queer fashion , to swim off into the air . i snored ; rolled over ; and there i was in my hammock ! now , what do you think of that dream , flask ?\" \" i don \\' t know ; it seems a sort of foolish to me , tho .\\'\" \" may be ; may be . but it \\' s made a wise man of me , flask . d \\' ye see ahab standing there , sideways looking over the stern ? well , the best thing you can do , flask , is to let the old man alone ; never speak to him , whatever he says . halloa ! what \\' s that he shouts ? hark !\" \" mast - head , there ! look sharp , all of ye ! there are whales hereabouts ! if ye see a white one , split your lungs for him ! \" what do you think of that now , flask ? ain \\' t there a small drop of something queer about that , eh ? a white whale -- did ye mark that , man ? look ye -- there \\' s something special in the wind . stand by for it , flask . ahab has that that \\' s bloody on his mind . but , mum ; he comes this way .\" chapter 32 cetology . already we are boldly launched upon the deep ; but soon we shall be lost in its unshored , harbourless immensities . ere that come to pass ; ere the pequod \\' s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan ; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow . it is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera , that i would now fain put before you . yet is it no easy task . the classification of the constituents of a chaos , nothing less is here essayed . listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down . \" no branch of zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled cetology ,\" says captain scoresby , a . d . 1820 . \" it is not my intention , were it in my power , to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families .... utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal \" ( sperm whale ), says surgeon beale , a . d . 1839 . \" unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters .\" \" impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea .\" \" a field strewn with thorns .\" \" all these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists .\" thus speak of the whale , the great cuvier , and john hunter , and lesson , those lights of zoology and anatomy . nevertheless , though of real knowledge there be little , yet of books there are a plenty ; and so in some small degree , with cetology , or the science of whales . many are the men , small and great , old and new , landsmen and seamen , who have at large or in little , written of the whale . run over a few :-- the authors of the bible ; aristotle ; pliny ; aldrovandi ; sir thomas browne ; gesner ; ray ; linnaeus ; rondeletius ; willoughby ; green ; artedi ; sibbald ; brisson ; marten ; lacepede ; bonneterre ; desmarest ; baron cuvier ; frederick cuvier ; john hunter ; owen ; scoresby ; beale ; bennett ; j . ross browne ; the author of miriam coffin ; olmstead ; and the rev . t . cheever . but to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written , the above cited extracts will show . of the names in this list of whale authors , only those following owen ever saw living whales ; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman . i mean captain scoresby . on the separate subject of the greenland or right - whale , he is the best existing authority . but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale , compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning . and here be it said , that the greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas . he is not even by any means the largest of the whales . yet , owing to the long priority of his claims , and the profound ignorance which , till some seventy years back , invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm - whale , and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale - ports ; this usurpation has been every way complete . reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days , will satisfy you that the greenland whale , without one rival , was to them the monarch of the seas . but the time has at last come for a new proclamation . this is charing cross ; hear ye ! good people all ,-- the greenland whale is deposed ,-- the great sperm whale now reigneth ! there are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you , and at the same time , in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt . those books are beale \\' s and bennett \\' s ; both in their time surgeons to english south - sea whale - ships , and both exact and reliable men . the original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small ; but so far as it goes , it is of excellent quality , though mostly confined to scientific description . as yet , however , the sperm whale , scientific or poetic , lives not complete in any literature . far above all other hunted whales , his is an unwritten life . now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification , if only an easy outline one for the present , hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers . as no better man advances to take this matter in hand , i hereupon offer my own poor endeavors . i promise nothing complete ; because any human thing supposed to be complete , must for that very reason infallibly be faulty . i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species , or -- in this place at least -- to much of any description . my object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology . i am the architect , not the builder . but it is a ponderous task ; no ordinary letter - sorter in the post - office is equal to it . to grope down into the bottom of the sea after them ; to have one \\' s hands among the unspeakable foundations , ribs , and very pelvis of the world ; this is a fearful thing . what am i that i should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan ! the awful tauntings in job might well appal me . \" will he the ( leviathan ) make a covenant with thee ? behold the hope of him is vain ! but i have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans ; i have had to do with whales with these visible hands ; i am in earnest ; and i will try . there are some preliminaries to settle . first : the uncertain , unsettled condition of this science of cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact , that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish . in his system of nature , a . d . 1776 , linnaeus declares , \" i hereby separate the whales from the fish .\" but of my own knowledge , i know that down to the year 1850 , sharks and shad , alewives and herring , against linnaeus \\' s express edict , were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the leviathan . the grounds upon which linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters , he states as follows : \" on account of their warm bilocular heart , their lungs , their movable eyelids , their hollow ears , penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem ,\" and finally , \" ex lege naturae jure meritoque .\" i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley coffin , of nantucket , both messmates of mine in a certain voyage , and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient . charley profanely hinted they were humbug . be it known that , waiving all argument , i take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish , and call upon holy jonah to back me . this fundamental thing settled , the next point is , in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish . above , linnaeus has given you those items . but in brief , they are these : lungs and warm blood ; whereas , all other fish are lungless and cold blooded . next : how shall we define the whale , by his obvious externals , so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come ? to be short , then , a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail . there you have him . however contracted , that definition is the result of expanded meditation . a walrus spouts much like a whale , but the walrus is not a fish , because he is amphibious . but the last term of the definition is still more cogent , as coupled with the first . almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat , but a vertical , or up - and - down tail . whereas , among spouting fish the tail , though it may be similarly shaped , invariably assumes a horizontal position . by the above definition of what a whale is , i do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed nantucketers ; nor , on the other hand , link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien .* hence , all the smaller , spouting , and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground - plan of cetology . now , then , come the grand divisions of the entire whale host . * i am aware that down to the present time , the fish styled lamatins and dugongs ( pig - fish and sow - fish of the coffins of nantucket ) are included by many naturalists among the whales . but as these pig - fish are a noisy , contemptible set , mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers , and feeding on wet hay , and especially as they do not spout , i deny their credentials as whales ; and have presented them with their passports to quit the kingdom of cetology . first : according to magnitude i divide the whales into three primary books ( subdivisible into chapters ), and these shall comprehend them all , both small and large . i . the folio whale ; ii . the octavo whale ; iii . the duodecimo whale . as the type of the folio i present the sperm whale ; of the octavo , the grampus ; of the duodecimo , the porpoise . folios . among these i here include the following chapters :-- i . the sperm whale ; ii . the right whale ; iii . the fin - back whale ; iv . the hump - backed whale ; v . the razor - back whale ; vi . the sulphur - bottom whale . book i . ( folio ), chapter i . ( sperm whale ).-- this whale , among the english of old vaguely known as the trumpa whale , and the physeter whale , and the anvil headed whale , is the present cachalot of the french , and the pottsfich of the germans , and the macrocephalus of the long words . he is , without doubt , the largest inhabitant of the globe ; the most formidable of all whales to encounter ; the most majestic in aspect ; and lastly , by far the most valuable in commerce ; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance , spermaceti , is obtained . all his peculiarities will , in many other places , be enlarged upon . it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do . philologically considered , it is absurd . some centuries ago , when the sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality , and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish ; in those days spermaceti , it would seem , was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in england as the greenland or right whale . it was the idea also , that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses . in those times , also , spermaceti was exceedingly scarce , not being used for light , but only as an ointment and medicament . it was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb . when , as i opine , in the course of time , the true nature of spermaceti became known , its original name was still retained by the dealers ; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity . and so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived . book i . ( folio ), chapter ii . ( right whale ).-- in one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans , being the one first regularly hunted by man . it yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen ; and the oil specially known as \" whale oil ,\" an inferior article in commerce . among the fishermen , he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles : the whale ; the greenland whale ; the black whale ; the great whale ; the true whale ; the right whale . there is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised . what then is the whale , which i include in the second species of my folios ? it is the great mysticetus of the english naturalists ; the greenland whale of the english whalemen ; the baliene ordinaire of the french whalemen ; the growlands walfish of the swedes . it is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the dutch and english in the arctic seas ; it is the whale which the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean , on the brazil banks , on the nor \\' west coast , and various other parts of the world , designated by them right whale cruising grounds . some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the english and the right whale of the americans . but they precisely agree in all their grand features ; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction . it is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences , that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate . the right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length , with reference to elucidating the sperm whale . book i . ( folio ), chapter iii . ( fin - back ).-- under this head i reckon a monster which , by the various names of fin - back , tall - spout , and long - john , has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the atlantic , in the new york packet - tracks . in the length he attains , and in his baleen , the fin - back resembles the right whale , but is of a less portly girth , and a lighter colour , approaching to olive . his great lips present a cable - like aspect , formed by the intertwisting , slanting folds of large wrinkles . his grand distinguishing feature , the fin , from which he derives his name , is often a conspicuous object . this fin is some three or four feet long , growing vertically from the hinder part of the back , of an angular shape , and with a very sharp pointed end . even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible , this isolated fin will , at times , be seen plainly projecting from the surface . when the sea is moderately calm , and slightly marked with spherical ripples , and this gnomon - like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface , it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial , with its style and wavy hour - lines graved on it . on that ahaz - dial the shadow often goes back . the fin - back is not gregarious . he seems a whale - hater , as some men are man - haters . very shy ; always going solitary ; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters ; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain ; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming , as to defy all present pursuit from man ; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cain of his race , bearing for his mark that style upon his back . from having the baleen in his mouth , the fin - back is sometimes included with the right whale , among a theoretic species denominated whalebone whales , that is , whales with baleen . of these so called whalebone whales , there would seem to be several varieties , most of which , however , are little known . broad - nosed whales and beaked whales ; pike - headed whales ; bunched whales ; under - jawed whales and rostrated whales , are the fishermen \\' s names for a few sorts . in connection with this appellative of \" whalebone whales ,\" it is of great importance to mention , that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales , yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan , founded upon either his baleen , or hump , or fin , or teeth ; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions , which the whale , in his kinds , presents . how then ? the baleen , hump , back - fin , and teeth ; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales , without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars . thus , the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale , each has a hump ; but there the similitude ceases . then , this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale , each of these has baleen ; but there again the similitude ceases . and it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned . in various sorts of whales , they form such irregular combinations ; or , in the case of any one of them detached , such an irregular isolation ; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis . on this rock every one of the whale - naturalists has split . but it may possibly be conceived that , in the internal parts of the whale , in his anatomy -- there , at least , we shall be able to hit the right classification . nay ; what thing , for example , is there in the greenland whale \\' s anatomy more striking than his baleen ? yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the greenland whale . and if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans , why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated . what then remains ? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily , in their entire liberal volume , and boldly sort them that way . and this is the bibliographical system here adopted ; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed , for it alone is practicable . to proceed . book i . ( folio ) chapter iv . ( hump - back ).-- this whale is often seen on the northern american coast . he has been frequently captured there , and towed into harbor . he has a great pack on him like a peddler ; or you might call him the elephant and castle whale . at any rate , the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him , since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one . his oil is not very valuable . he has baleen . he is the most gamesome and light - hearted of all the whales , making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them . book i . ( folio ), chapter v . ( razor - back ).-- of this whale little is known but his name . i have seen him at a distance off cape horn . of a retiring nature , he eludes both hunters and philosophers . though no coward , he has never yet shown any part of him but his back , which rises in a long sharp ridge . let him go . i know little more of him , nor does anybody else . book i . ( folio ), chapter vi . ( sulphur - bottom ).-- another retiring gentleman , with a brimstone belly , doubtless got by scraping along the tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings . he is seldom seen ; at least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas , and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance . he is never chased ; he would run away with rope - walks of line . prodigies are told of him . adieu , sulphur bottom ! i can say nothing more that is true of ye , nor can the oldest nantucketer . thus ends book i . ( folio ), and now begins book ii . ( octavo ). octavoes .*-- these embrace the whales of middling magnitude , among which present may be numbered :-- i ., the grampus ; ii ., the black fish ; iii ., the narwhale ; iv ., the thrasher ; v ., the killer . * why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain . because , while the whales of this order , though smaller than those of the former order , nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure , yet the bookbinder \\' s quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the folio volume , but the octavo volume does . book ii . ( octavo ), chapter i . ( grampus ).-- though this fish , whose loud sonorous breathing , or rather blowing , has furnished a proverb to landsmen , is so well known a denizen of the deep , yet is he not popularly classed among whales . but possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan , most naturalists have recognised him for one . he is of moderate octavo size , varying from fifteen to twenty - five feet in length , and of corresponding dimensions round the waist . he swims in herds ; he is never regularly hunted , though his oil is considerable in quantity , and pretty good for light . by some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale . book ii . ( octavo ), chapter ii . ( black fish ).-- i give the popular fishermen \\' s names for all these fish , for generally they are the best . where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive , i shall say so , and suggest another . i do so now , touching the black fish , so - called , because blackness is the rule among almost all whales . so , call him the hyena whale , if you please . his voracity is well known , and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards , he carries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face . this whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length . he is found in almost all latitudes . he has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming , which looks something like a roman nose . when not more profitably employed , the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the hyena whale , to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment -- as some frugal housekeepers , in the absence of company , and quite alone by themselves , burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax . though their blubber is very thin , some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil . book ii . ( octavo ), chapter iii . ( narwhale ), that is , nostril whale .-- another instance of a curiously named whale , so named i suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose . the creature is some sixteen feet in length , while its horn averages five feet , though some exceed ten , and even attain to fifteen feet . strictly speaking , this horn is but a lengthened tusk , growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal . but it is only found on the sinister side , which has an ill effect , giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left - handed man . what precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers , it would be hard to say . it does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword - fish and bill - fish ; though some sailors tell me that the narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food . charley coffin said it was used for an ice - piercer ; for the narwhale , rising to the surface of the polar sea , and finding it sheeted with ice , thrusts his horn up , and so breaks through . but you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct . my own opinion is , that however this one - sided horn may really be used by the narwhale -- however that may be -- it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets . the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale , the horned whale , and the unicorn whale . he is certainly a curious example of the unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature . from certain cloistered old authors i have gathered that this same sea - unicorn \\' s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison , and as such , preparations of it brought immense prices . it was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies , the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn . originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity . black letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return from that voyage , when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of greenwich palace , as his bold ship sailed down the thames ; \" when sir martin returned from that voyage ,\" saith black letter , \" on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the narwhale , which for a long period after hung in the castle at windsor .\" an irish author avers that the earl of leicester , on bended knees , did likewise present to her highness another horn , pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature . the narwhale has a very picturesque , leopard - like look , being of a milk - white ground colour , dotted with round and oblong spots of black . his oil is very superior , clear and fine ; but there is little of it , and he is seldom hunted . he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas . book ii . ( octavo ), chapter iv . ( killer ).-- of this whale little is precisely known to the nantucketer , and nothing at all to the professed naturalist . from what i have seen of him at a distance , i should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus . he is very savage -- a sort of feegee fish . he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip , and hangs there like a leech , till the mighty brute is worried to death . the killer is never hunted . i never heard what sort of oil he has . exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale , on the ground of its indistinctness . for we are all killers , on land and on sea ; bonapartes and sharks included . book ii . ( octavo ), chapter v . ( thrasher ).-- this gentleman is famous for his tail , which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes . he mounts the folio whale \\' s back , and as he swims , he works his passage by flogging him ; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process . still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer . both are outlaws , even in the lawless seas . thus ends book ii . ( octavo ), and begins book iii . ( duodecimo ). duodecimoes .-- these include the smaller whales . i . the huzza porpoise . ii . the algerine porpoise . iii . the mealy - mouthed porpoise . to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject , it may possibly seem strange , that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among whales -- a word , which , in the popular sense , always conveys an idea of hugeness . but the creatures set down above as duodecimoes are infallibly whales , by the terms of my definition of what a whale is -- i . e . a spouting fish , with a horizontal tail . book iii . ( duodecimo ), chapter 1 . ( huzza porpoise ).-- this is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe . the name is of my own bestowal ; for there are more than one sort of porpoises , and something must be done to distinguish them . i call him thus , because he always swims in hilarious shoals , which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a fourth - of - july crowd . their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner . full of fine spirits , they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward . they are the lads that always live before the wind . they are accounted a lucky omen . if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish , then heaven help ye ; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye . a well - fed , plump huzza porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil . but the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable . it is in request among jewellers and watchmakers . sailors put it on their hones . porpoise meat is good eating , you know . it may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts . indeed , his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible . but the next time you have a chance , watch him ; and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature . book iii . ( duodecimo ), chapter ii . ( algerine porpoise ).-- a pirate . very savage . he is only found , i think , in the pacific . he is somewhat larger than the huzza porpoise , but much of the same general make . provoke him , and he will buckle to a shark . i have lowered for him many times , but never yet saw him captured . book iii . ( duodecimo ), chapter iii . ( mealy - mouthed porpoise ).-- the largest kind of porpoise ; and only found in the pacific , so far as it is known . the only english name , by which he has hitherto been designated , is that of the fishers -- right - whale porpoise , from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio . in shape , he differs in some degree from the huzza porpoise , being of a less rotund and jolly girth ; indeed , he is of quite a neat and gentleman - like figure . he has no fins on his back ( most other porpoises have ), he has a lovely tail , and sentimental indian eyes of a hazel hue . but his mealy - mouth spoils all . though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable , yet a boundary line , distinct as the mark in a ship \\' s hull , called the \" bright waist ,\" that line streaks him from stem to stern , with two separate colours , black above and white below . the white comprises part of his head , and the whole of his mouth , which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal - bag . a most mean and mealy aspect ! his oil is much like that of the common porpoise . beyond the duodecimo , this system does not proceed , inasmuch as the porpoise is the smallest of the whales . above , you have all the leviathans of note . but there are a rabble of uncertain , fugitive , half - fabulous whales , which , as an american whaleman , i know by reputation , but not personally . i shall enumerate them by their fore - castle appellations ; for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators , who may complete what i have here but begun . if any of the following whales , shall hereafter be caught and marked , then he can readily be incorporated into this system , according to his folio , octavo , or duodecimo magnitude :-- the bottle - nose whale ; the junk whale ; the pudding - headed whale ; the cape whale ; the leading whale ; the cannon whale ; the scragg whale ; the coppered whale ; the elephant whale ; the iceberg whale ; the quog whale ; the blue whale ; etc . from icelandic , dutch , and old english authorities , there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales , blessed with all manner of uncouth names . but i omit them as altogether obsolete ; and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds , full of leviathanism , but signifying nothing . finally : it was stated at the outset , that this system would not be here , and at once , perfected . you cannot but plainly see that i have kept my word . but i now leave my cetological system standing thus unfinished , even as the great cathedral of cologne was left , with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower . for small erections may be finished by their first architects ; grand ones , true ones , ever leave the copestone to posterity . god keep me from ever completing anything . this whole book is but a draught -- nay , but the draught of a draught . oh , time , strength , cash , and patience ! chapter 33 the specksynder . concerning the officers of the whale - craft , this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship - board , arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers , a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale - fleet . the large importance attached to the harpooneer \\' s vocation is evinced by the fact , that originally in the old dutch fishery , two centuries and more ago , the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain , but was divided between him and an officer called the specksynder . literally this word means fat - cutter ; usage , however , in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer . in those days , the captain \\' s authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel ; while over the whale - hunting department and all its concerns , the specksynder or chief harpooneer reigned supreme . in the british greenland fishery , under the corrupted title of specksioneer , this old dutch official is still retained , but his former dignity is sadly abridged . at present he ranks simply as senior harpooneer ; and as such , is but one of the captain \\' s more inferior subalterns . nevertheless , as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends , and since in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat , but under certain circumstances ( night watches on a whaling ground ) the command of the ship \\' s deck is also his ; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands , that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast , and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior ; though always , by them , familiarly regarded as their social equal . now , the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea , is this -- the first lives aft , the last forward . hence , in whale - ships and merchantmen alike , the mates have their quarters with the captain ; and so , too , in most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship . that is to say , they take their meals in the captain \\' s cabin , and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it . though the long period of a southern whaling voyage ( by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man ), the peculiar perils of it , and the community of interest prevailing among a company , all of whom , high or low , depend for their profits , not upon fixed wages , but upon their common luck , together with their common vigilance , intrepidity , and hard work ; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally ; yet , never mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may , in some primitive instances , live together ; for all that , the punctilious externals , at least , of the quarter - deck are seldom materially relaxed , and in no instance done away . indeed , many are the nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter - deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy ; nay , extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple , and not the shabbiest of pilot - cloth . and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption ; and though the only homage he ever exacted , was implicit , instantaneous obedience ; though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter - deck ; and though there were times when , owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed , he addressed them in unusual terms , whether of condescension or in terrorem , or otherwise ; yet even captain ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea . nor , perhaps , will it fail to be eventually perceived , that behind those forms and usages , as it were , he sometimes masked himself ; incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve . that certain sultanism of his brain , which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested ; through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship . for be a man \\' s intellectual superiority what it will , it can never assume the practical , available supremacy over other men , without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments , always , in themselves , more or less paltry and base . this it is , that for ever keeps god \\' s true princes of the empire from the world \\' s hustings ; and leaves the highest honours that this air can give , to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert , than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass . such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them , that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency . but when , as in the case of nicholas the czar , the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain ; then , the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization . nor , will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing , ever forget a hint , incidentally so important in his art , as the one now alluded to . but ahab , my captain , still moves before me in all his nantucket grimness and shagginess ; and in this episode touching emperors and kings , i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old whale - hunter like him ; and , therefore , all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me . oh , ahab ! what shall be grand in thee , it must needs be plucked at from the skies , and dived for in the deep , and featured in the unbodied air ! chapter 34 the cabin - table . it is noon ; and dough - boy , the steward , thrusting his pale loaf - of - bread face from the cabin - scuttle , announces dinner to his lord and master ; who , sitting in the lee quarter - boat , has just been taking an observation of the sun ; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth , medallion - shaped tablet , reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg . from his complete inattention to the tidings , you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial . but presently , catching hold of the mizen shrouds , he swings himself to the deck , and in an even , unexhilarated voice , saying , \" dinner , mr . starbuck ,\" disappears into the cabin . when the last echo of his sultan \\' s step has died away , and starbuck , the first emir , has every reason to suppose that he is seated , then starbuck rouses from his quietude , takes a few turns along the planks , and , after a grave peep into the binnacle , says , with some touch of pleasantness , \" dinner , mr . stubb ,\" and descends the scuttle . the second emir lounges about the rigging awhile , and then slightly shaking the main brace , to see whether it will be all right with that important rope , he likewise takes up the old burden , and with a rapid \" dinner , mr . flask ,\" follows after his predecessors . but the third emir , now seeing himself all alone on the quarter - deck , seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint ; for , tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions , and kicking off his shoes , he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the grand turk \\' s head ; and then , by a dexterous sleight , pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf , he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck , reversing all other processions , by bringing up the rear with music . but ere stepping into the cabin doorway below , he pauses , ships a new face altogether , and , then , independent , hilarious little flask enters king ahab \\' s presence , in the character of abjectus , or the slave . it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea - usages , that while in the open air of the deck some officers will , upon provocation , bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander ; yet , ten to one , let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander \\' s cabin , and straightway their inoffensive , not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him , as he sits at the head of the table ; this is marvellous , sometimes most comical . wherefore this difference ? a problem ? perhaps not . to have been belshazzar , king of babylon ; and to have been belshazzar , not haughtily but courteously , therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur . but he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner - table of invited guests , that man \\' s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time ; that man \\' s royalty of state transcends belshazzar \\' s , for belshazzar was not the greatest . who has but once dined his friends , has tasted what it is to be caesar . it is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding . now , if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship - master , then , by inference , you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea - life just mentioned . over his ivory - inlaid table , ahab presided like a mute , maned sea - lion on the white coral beach , surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs . in his own proper turn , each officer waited to be served . they were as little children before ahab ; and yet , in ahab , there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance . with one mind , their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man \\' s knife , as he carved the chief dish before him . i do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation , even upon so neutral a topic as the weather . no ! and when reaching out his knife and fork , between which the slice of beef was locked , ahab thereby motioned starbuck \\' s plate towards him , the mate received his meat as though receiving alms ; and cut it tenderly ; and a little started if , perchance , the knife grazed against the plate ; and chewed it noiselessly ; and swallowed it , not without circumspection . for , like the coronation banquet at frankfort , where the german emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors , so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals , eaten in awful silence ; and yet at table old ahab forbade not conversation ; only he himself was dumb . what a relief it was to choking stubb , when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below . and poor little flask , he was the youngest son , and little boy of this weary family party . his were the shinbones of the saline beef ; his would have been the drumsticks . for flask to have presumed to help himself , this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree . had he helped himself at that table , doubtless , never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world ; nevertheless , strange to say , ahab never forbade him . and had flask helped himself , the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it . least of all , did flask presume to help himself to butter . whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him , on account of its clotting his clear , sunny complexion ; or whether he deemed that , on so long a voyage in such marketless waters , butter was at a premium , and therefore was not for him , a subaltern ; however it was , flask , alas ! was a butterless man ! another thing . flask was the last person down at the dinner , and flask is the first man up . consider ! for hereby flask \\' s dinner was badly jammed in point of time . starbuck and stubb both had the start of him ; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear . if stubb even , who is but a peg higher than flask , happens to have but a small appetite , and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast , then flask must bestir himself , he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day ; for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck . therefore it was that flask once admitted in private , that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer , from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry , more or less . for what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger , as keep it immortal in him . peace and satisfaction , thought flask , have for ever departed from my stomach . i am an officer ; but , how i wish i could fish a bit of old - fashioned beef in the forecastle , as i used to when i was before the mast . there \\' s the fruits of promotion now ; there \\' s the vanity of glory : there \\' s the insanity of life ! besides , if it were so that any mere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flask \\' s official capacity , all that sailor had to do , in order to obtain ample vengeance , was to go aft at dinner - time , and get a peep at flask through the cabin sky - light , sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab . now , ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the pequod \\' s cabin . after their departure , taking place in inverted order to their arrival , the canvas cloth was cleared , or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward . and then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast , they being its residuary legatees . they made a sort of temporary servants \\' hall of the high and mighty cabin . in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain \\' s table , was the entire care - free license and ease , the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers . while their masters , the mates , seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws , the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it . they dined like lords ; they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loading with spices . such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego , that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast , often the pale dough - boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt - junk , seemingly quarried out of the solid ox . and if he were not lively about it , if he did not go with a nimble hop - skip - and - jump , then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back , harpoon - wise . and once daggoo , seized with a sudden humor , assisted dough - boy \\' s memory by snatching him up bodily , and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher , while tashtego , knife in hand , began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him . he was naturally a very nervous , shuddering sort of little fellow , this bread - faced steward ; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse . and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab , and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages , dough - boy \\' s whole life was one continual lip - quiver . commonly , after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded , he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining , and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door , till all was over . it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego , opposing his filed teeth to the indian \\' s : crosswise to them , daggoo seated on the floor , for a bench would have brought his hearse - plumed head to the low carlines ; at every motion of his colossal limbs , making the low cabin framework to shake , as when an african elephant goes passenger in a ship . but for all this , the great negro was wonderfully abstemious , not to say dainty . it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad , baronial , and superb a person . but , doubtless , this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air ; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds . not by beef or by bread , are giants made or nourished . but queequeg , he had a mortal , barbaric smack of the lip in eating -- an ugly sound enough -- so much so , that the trembling dough - boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms . and when he would hear tashtego singing out for him to produce himself , that his bones might be picked , the simple - witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry , by his sudden fits of the palsy . nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets , for their lances and other weapons ; and with which whetstones , at dinner , they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives ; that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor dough - boy . how could he forget that in his island days , queequeg , for one , must certainly have been guilty of some murderous , convivial indiscretions . alas ! dough - boy ! hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals . not a napkin should he carry on his arm , but a buckler . in good time , though , to his great delight , the three salt - sea warriors would rise and depart ; to his credulous , fable - mongering ears , all their martial bones jingling in them at every step , like moorish scimetars in scabbards . but , though these barbarians dined in the cabin , and nominally lived there ; still , being anything but sedentary in their habits , they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes , and just before sleeping - time , when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters . in this one matter , ahab seemed no exception to most american whale captains , who , as a set , rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship \\' s cabin belongs to them ; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is , at any time , permitted there . so that , in real truth , the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it . for when they did enter it , it was something as a street - door enters a house ; turning inwards for a moment , only to be turned out the next ; and , as a permanent thing , residing in the open air . nor did they lose much hereby ; in the cabin was no companionship ; socially , ahab was inaccessible . though nominally included in the census of christendom , he was still an alien to it . he lived in the world , as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled missouri . and as when spring and summer had departed , that wild logan of the woods , burying himself in the hollow of a tree , lived out the winter there , sucking his own paws ; so , in his inclement , howling old age , ahab \\' s soul , shut up in the caved trunk of his body , there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom ! chapter 35 the mast - head . it was during the more pleasant weather , that in due rotation with the other seamen my first mast - head came round . in most american whalemen the mast - heads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel \\' s leaving her port ; even though she may have fifteen thousand miles , and more , to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground . and if , after a three , four , or five years \\' voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her -- say , an empty vial even -- then , her mast - heads are kept manned to the last ; and not till her skysail - poles sail in among the spires of the port , does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more . now , as the business of standing mast - heads , ashore or afloat , is a very ancient and interesting one , let us in some measure expatiate here . i take it , that the earliest standers of mast - heads were the old egyptians ; because , in all my researches , i find none prior to them . for though their progenitors , the builders of babel , must doubtless , by their tower , have intended to rear the loftiest mast - head in all asia , or africa either ; yet ( ere the final truck was put to it ) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board , in the dread gale of god \\' s wrath ; therefore , we cannot give these babel builders priority over the egyptians . and that the egyptians were a nation of mast - head standers , is an assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists , that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes : a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair - like formation of all four sides of those edifices ; whereby , with prodigious long upliftings of their legs , those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex , and sing out for new stars ; even as the look - outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail , or a whale just bearing in sight . in saint stylites , the famous christian hermit of old times , who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit , hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle ; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander - of - mast - heads ; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts , rain , hail , or sleet ; but valiantly facing everything out to the last , literally died at his post . of modern standers - of - mast - heads we have but a lifeless set ; mere stone , iron , and bronze men ; who , though well capable of facing out a stiff gale , are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight . there is napoleon ; who , upon the top of the column of vendome , stands with arms folded , some one hundred and fifty feet in the air ; careless , now , who rules the decks below ; whether louis philippe , louis blanc , or louis the devil . great washington , too , stands high aloft on his towering main - mast in baltimore , and like one of hercules \\' pillars , his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go . admiral nelson , also , on a capstan of gun - metal , stands his mast - head in trafalgar square ; and ever when most obscured by that london smoke , token is yet given that a hidden hero is there ; for where there is smoke , must be fire . but neither great washington , nor napoleon , nor nelson , will answer a single hail from below , however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze ; however it may be surmised , that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future , and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned . it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast - head standers of the land with those of the sea ; but that in truth it is not so , is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy , the sole historian of nantucket , stands accountable . the worthy obed tells us , that in the early times of the whale fishery , ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game , the people of that island erected lofty spars along the sea - coast , to which the look - outs ascended by means of nailed cleats , something as fowls go upstairs in a hen - house . a few years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of new zealand , who , upon descrying the game , gave notice to the ready - manned boats nigh the beach . but this custom has now become obsolete ; turn we then to the one proper mast - head , that of a whale - ship at sea . the three mast - heads are kept manned from sun - rise to sun - set ; the seamen taking their regular turns ( as at the helm ), and relieving each other every two hours . in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast - head ; nay , to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful . there you stand , a hundred feet above the silent decks , striding along the deep , as if the masts were gigantic stilts , while beneath you and between your legs , as it were , swim the hugest monsters of the sea , even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at old rhodes . there you stand , lost in the infinite series of the sea , with nothing ruffled but the waves . the tranced ship indolently rolls ; the drowsy trade winds blow ; everything resolves you into languor . for the most part , in this tropic whaling life , a sublime uneventfulness invests you ; you hear no news ; read no gazettes ; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements ; you hear of no domestic afflictions ; bankrupt securities ; fall of stocks ; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner -- for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks , and your bill of fare is immutable . in one of those southern whalesmen , on a long three or four years \\' voyage , as often happens , the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast - head would amount to several entire months . and it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life , should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness , or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling , such as pertains to a bed , a hammock , a hearse , a sentry box , a pulpit , a coach , or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves . your most usual point of perch is the head of the t \\' gallant - mast , where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks ( almost peculiar to whalemen ) called the t \\' gallant cross - trees . here , tossed about by the sea , the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull \\' s horns . to be sure , in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you , in the shape of a watch - coat ; but properly speaking the thickest watch - coat is no more of a house than the unclad body ; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle , and cannot freely move about in it , nor even move out of it , without running great risk of perishing ( like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alps in winter ); so a watch - coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope , or additional skin encasing you . you cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body , and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch - coat . concerning all this , it is much to be deplored that the mast - heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits , called crow \\' s - nests , in which the look - outs of a greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas . in the fireside narrative of captain sleet , entitled \" a voyage among the icebergs , in quest of the greenland whale , and incidentally for the re - discovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland ;\" in this admirable volume , all standers of mast - heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented crow \\' s - nest of the glacier , which was the name of captain sleet \\' s good craft . he called it the sleet \\' s crow \\' s - nest , in honour of himself ; he being the original inventor and patentee , and free from all ridiculous false delicacy , and holding that if we call our own children after our own names ( we fathers being the original inventors and patentees ), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget . in shape , the sleet \\' s crow \\' s - nest is something like a large tierce or pipe ; it is open above , however , where it is furnished with a movable side - screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale . being fixed on the summit of the mast , you ascend into it through a little trap - hatch in the bottom . on the after side , or side next the stern of the ship , is a comfortable seat , with a locker underneath for umbrellas , comforters , and coats . in front is a leather rack , in which to keep your speaking trumpet , pipe , telescope , and other nautical conveniences . when captain sleet in person stood his mast - head in this crow \\' s - nest of his , he tells us that he always had a rifle with him ( also fixed in the rack ), together with a powder flask and shot , for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales , or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters ; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water , but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing . now , it was plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe , as he does , all the little detailed conveniences of his crow \\' s - nest ; but though he so enlarges upon many of these , and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crow \\' s - nest , with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the \" local attraction \" of all binnacle magnets ; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship \\' s planks , and in the glacier \\' s case , perhaps , to there having been so many broken - down blacksmiths among her crew ; i say , that though the captain is very discreet and scientific here , yet , for all his learned \" binnacle deviations ,\" \" azimuth compass observations ,\" and \" approximate errors ,\" he knows very well , captain sleet , that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations , as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case - bottle , so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow \\' s nest , within easy reach of his hand . though , upon the whole , i greatly admire and even love the brave , the honest , and learned captain ; yet i take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case - bottle , seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been , while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird \\' s nest within three or four perches of the pole . but if we southern whale - fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as captain sleet and his greenlandmen were ; yet that disadvantage is greatly counter - balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float . for one , i used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely , resting in the top to have a chat with queequeg , or any one else off duty whom i might find there ; then ascending a little way further , and throwing a lazy leg over the top - sail yard , take a preliminary view of the watery pastures , and so at last mount to my ultimate destination . let me make a clean breast of it here , and frankly admit that i kept but sorry guard . with the problem of the universe revolving in me , how could i -- being left completely to myself at such a thought - engendering altitude -- how could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale - ships \\' standing orders , \" keep your weather eye open , and sing out every time .\" and let me in this place movingly admonish you , ye ship - owners of nantucket ! beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye ; given to unseasonable meditativeness ; and who offers to ship with the phaedon instead of bowditch in his head . beware of such an one , i say ; your whales must be seen before they can be killed ; and this sunken - eyed young platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world , and never make you one pint of sperm the richer . nor are these monitions at all unneeded . for nowadays , the whale - fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic , melancholy , and absent - minded young men , disgusted with the carking cares of earth , and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber . childe harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the mast - head of some luckless disappointed whale - ship , and in moody phrase ejaculates :-- \" roll on , thou deep and dark blue ocean , roll ! ten thousand blubber - hunters sweep over thee in vain .\" very often do the captains of such ships take those absent - minded young philosophers to task , upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient \" interest \" in the voyage ; half - hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition , as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise . but all in vain ; those young platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect ; they are short - sighted ; what use , then , to strain the visual nerve ? they have left their opera - glasses at home . \" why , thou monkey ,\" said a harpooneer to one of these lads , \" we \\' ve been cruising now hard upon three years , and thou hast not raised a whale yet . whales are scarce as hen \\' s teeth whenever thou art up here .\" perhaps they were ; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon ; but lulled into such an opium - like listlessness of vacant , unconscious reverie is this absent - minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts , that at last he loses his identity ; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep , blue , bottomless soul , pervading mankind and nature ; and every strange , half - seen , gliding , beautiful thing that eludes him ; every dimly - discovered , uprising fin of some undiscernible form , seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it . in this enchanted mood , thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came ; becomes diffused through time and space ; like crammer \\' s sprinkled pantheistic ashes , forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over . there is no life in thee , now , except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship ; by her , borrowed from the sea ; by the sea , from the inscrutable tides of god . but while this sleep , this dream is on ye , move your foot or hand an inch ; slip your hold at all ; and your identity comes back in horror . over descartian vortices you hover . and perhaps , at mid - day , in the fairest weather , with one half - throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea , no more to rise for ever . heed it well , ye pantheists ! chapter 36 the quarter - deck . ( enter ahab : then , all ) it was not a great while after the affair of the pipe , that one morning shortly after breakfast , ahab , as was his wont , ascended the cabin - gangway to the deck . there most sea - captains usually walk at that hour , as country gentlemen , after the same meal , take a few turns in the garden . soon his steady , ivory stride was heard , as to and fro he paced his old rounds , upon planks so familiar to his tread , that they were all over dented , like geological stones , with the peculiar mark of his walk . did you fixedly gaze , too , upon that ribbed and dented brow ; there also , you would see still stranger foot - prints -- the foot - prints of his one unsleeping , ever - pacing thought . but on the occasion in question , those dents looked deeper , even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark . and , so full of his thought was ahab , that at every uniform turn that he made , now at the main - mast and now at the binnacle , you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned , and pace in him as he paced ; so completely possessing him , indeed , that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement . \" d \\' ye mark him , flask ?\" whispered stubb ; \" the chick that \\' s in him pecks the shell . \\' twill soon be out .\" the hours wore on ;-- ahab now shut up within his cabin ; anon , pacing the deck , with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect . it drew near the close of day . suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks , and inserting his bone leg into the auger - hole there , and with one hand grasping a shroud , he ordered starbuck to send everybody aft . \" sir !\" said the mate , astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship - board except in some extraordinary case . \" send everybody aft ,\" repeated ahab . \" mast - heads , there ! come down !\" when the entire ship \\' s company were assembled , and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces , were eyeing him , for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up , ahab , after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks , and then darting his eyes among the crew , started from his standpoint ; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck . with bent head and half - slouched hat he continued to pace , unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men ; till stubb cautiously whispered to flask , that ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat . but this did not last long . vehemently pausing , he cried :-- \" what do ye do when ye see a whale , men ?\" \" sing out for him !\" was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices . \" good !\" cried ahab , with a wild approval in his tones ; observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them . \" and what do ye next , men ?\" \" lower away , and after him !\" \" and what tune is it ye pull to , men ?\" \" a dead whale or a stove boat !\" more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving , grew the countenance of the old man at every shout ; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other , as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions . but , they were all eagerness again , as ahab , now half - revolving in his pivot - hole , with one hand reaching high up a shroud , and tightly , almost convulsively grasping it , addressed them thus :-- \" all ye mast - headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale . look ye ! d \\' ye see this spanish ounce of gold ?\"-- holding up a broad bright coin to the sun --\" it is a sixteen dollar piece , men . d \\' ye see it ? mr . starbuck , hand me yon top - maul .\" while the mate was getting the hammer , ahab , without speaking , was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket , as if to heighten its lustre , and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself , producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him . receiving the top - maul from starbuck , he advanced towards the main - mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand , exhibiting the gold with the other , and with a high raised voice exclaiming : \" whosoever of ye raises me a white - headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw ; whosoever of ye raises me that white - headed whale , with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke -- look ye , whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale , he shall have this gold ounce , my boys !\" \" huzza ! huzza !\" cried the seamen , as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast . \" it \\' s a white whale , i say ,\" resumed ahab , as he threw down the topmaul : \" a white whale . skin your eyes for him , men ; look sharp for white water ; if ye see but a bubble , sing out .\" all this while tashtego , daggoo , and queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest , and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection . \" captain ahab ,\" said tashtego , \" that white whale must be the same that some call moby dick .\" \" moby dick ?\" shouted ahab . \" do ye know the white whale then , tash ?\" \" does he fan - tail a little curious , sir , before he goes down ?\" said the gay - header deliberately . \" and has he a curious spout , too ,\" said daggoo , \" very bushy , even for a parmacetty , and mighty quick , captain ahab ?\" \" and he have one , two , three -- oh ! good many iron in him hide , too , captain ,\" cried queequeg disjointedly , \" all twiske - tee be - twisk , like him -- him --\" faltering hard for a word , and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle --\" like him -- him --\" \" corkscrew !\" cried ahab , \" aye , queequeg , the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him ; aye , daggoo , his spout is a big one , like a whole shock of wheat , and white as a pile of our nantucket wool after the great annual sheep - shearing ; aye , tashtego , and he fan - tails like a split jib in a squall . death and devils ! men , it is moby dick ye have seen -- moby dick -- moby dick !\" \" captain ahab ,\" said starbuck , who , with stubb and flask , had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise , but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder . \" captain ahab , i have heard of moby dick -- but it was not moby dick that took off thy leg ?\" \" who told thee that ?\" cried ahab ; then pausing , \" aye , starbuck ; aye , my hearties all round ; it was moby dick that dismasted me ; moby dick that brought me to this dead stump i stand on now . aye , aye ,\" he shouted with a terrific , loud , animal sob , like that of a heart - stricken moose ; \" aye , aye ! it was that accursed white whale that razeed me ; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day !\" then tossing both arms , with measureless imprecations he shouted out : \" aye , aye ! and i \\' ll chase him round good hope , and round the horn , and round the norway maelstrom , and round perdition \\' s flames before i give him up . and this is what ye have shipped for , men ! to chase that white whale on both sides of land , and over all sides of earth , till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out . what say ye , men , will ye splice hands on it , now ? i think ye do look brave .\" \" aye , aye !\" shouted the harpooneers and seamen , running closer to the excited old man : \" a sharp eye for the white whale ; a sharp lance for moby dick !\" \" god bless ye ,\" he seemed to half sob and half shout . \" god bless ye , men . steward ! go draw the great measure of grog . but what \\' s this long face about , mr . starbuck ; wilt thou not chase the white whale ? art not game for moby dick ?\" \" i am game for his crooked jaw , and for the jaws of death too , captain ahab , if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow ; but i came here to hunt whales , not my commander \\' s vengeance . how many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it , captain ahab ? it will not fetch thee much in our nantucket market .\" \" nantucket market ! hoot ! but come closer , starbuck ; thou requirest a little lower layer . if money \\' s to be the measurer , man , and the accountants have computed their great counting - house the globe , by girdling it with guineas , one to every three parts of an inch ; then , let me tell thee , that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here !\" \" he smites his chest ,\" whispered stubb , \" what \\' s that for ? methinks it rings most vast , but hollow .\" \" vengeance on a dumb brute !\" cried starbuck , \" that simply smote thee from blindest instinct ! madness ! to be enraged with a dumb thing , captain ahab , seems blasphemous .\" \" hark ye yet again -- the little lower layer . all visible objects , man , are but as pasteboard masks . but in each event -- in the living act , the undoubted deed -- there , some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask . if man will strike , strike through the mask ! how can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall ? to me , the white whale is that wall , shoved near to me . sometimes i think there \\' s naught beyond . but \\' tis enough . he tasks me ; he heaps me ; i see in him outrageous strength , with an inscrutable malice sinewing it . that inscrutable thing is chiefly what i hate ; and be the white whale agent , or be the white whale principal , i will wreak that hate upon him . talk not to me of blasphemy , man ; i \\' d strike the sun if it insulted me . for could the sun do that , then could i do the other ; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein , jealousy presiding over all creations . but not my master , man , is even that fair play . who \\' s over me ? truth hath no confines . take off thine eye ! more intolerable than fiends \\' glarings is a doltish stare ! so , so ; thou reddenest and palest ; my heat has melted thee to anger - glow . but look ye , starbuck , what is said in heat , that thing unsays itself . there are men from whom warm words are small indignity . i meant not to incense thee . let it go . look ! see yonder turkish cheeks of spotted tawn -- living , breathing pictures painted by the sun . the pagan leopards -- the unrecking and unworshipping things , that live ; and seek , and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel ! the crew , man , the crew ! are they not one and all with ahab , in this matter of the whale ? see stubb ! he laughs ! see yonder chilian ! he snorts to think of it . stand up amid the general hurricane , thy one tost sapling cannot , starbuck ! and what is it ? reckon it . \\' tis but to help strike a fin ; no wondrous feat for starbuck . what is it more ? from this one poor hunt , then , the best lance out of all nantucket , surely he will not hang back , when every foremast - hand has clutched a whetstone ? ah ! constrainings seize thee ; i see ! the billow lifts thee ! speak , but speak !-- aye , aye ! thy silence , then , that voices thee . ( aside ) something shot from my dilated nostrils , he has inhaled it in his lungs . starbuck now is mine ; cannot oppose me now , without rebellion .\" \" god keep me !-- keep us all !\" murmured starbuck , lowly . but in his joy at the enchanted , tacit acquiescence of the mate , ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation ; nor yet the low laugh from the hold ; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage ; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts , as for a moment their hearts sank in . for again starbuck \\' s downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life ; the subterranean laugh died away ; the winds blew on ; the sails filled out ; the ship heaved and rolled as before . ah , ye admonitions and warnings ! why stay ye not when ye come ? but rather are ye predictions than warnings , ye shadows ! yet not so much predictions from without , as verifications of the foregoing things within . for with little external to constrain us , the innermost necessities in our being , these still drive us on . \" the measure ! the measure !\" cried ahab . receiving the brimming pewter , and turning to the harpooneers , he ordered them to produce their weapons . then ranging them before him near the capstan , with their harpoons in their hands , while his three mates stood at his side with their lances , and the rest of the ship \\' s company formed a circle round the group ; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew . but those wild eyes met his , as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader , ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison ; but , alas ! only to fall into the hidden snare of the indian . \" drink and pass !\" he cried , handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman . \" the crew alone now drink . round with it , round ! short draughts -- long swallows , men ; \\' tis hot as satan \\' s hoof . so , so ; it goes round excellently . it spiralizes in ye ; forks out at the serpent - snapping eye . well done ; almost drained . that way it went , this way it comes . hand it me -- here \\' s a hollow ! men , ye seem the years ; so brimming life is gulped and gone . steward , refill ! \" attend now , my braves . i have mustered ye all round this capstan ; and ye mates , flank me with your lances ; and ye harpooneers , stand there with your irons ; and ye , stout mariners , ring me in , that i may in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me . o men , you will yet see that -- ha ! boy , come back ? bad pennies come not sooner . hand it me . why , now , this pewter had run brimming again , were \\' t not thou st . vitus \\' imp -- away , thou ague ! \" advance , ye mates ! cross your lances full before me . well done ! let me touch the axis .\" so saying , with extended arm , he grasped the three level , radiating lances at their crossed centre ; while so doing , suddenly and nervously twitched them ; meanwhile , glancing intently from starbuck to stubb ; from stubb to flask . it seemed as though , by some nameless , interior volition , he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the leyden jar of his own magnetic life . the three mates quailed before his strong , sustained , and mystic aspect . stubb and flask looked sideways from him ; the honest eye of starbuck fell downright . \" in vain !\" cried ahab ; \" but , maybe , \\' tis well . for did ye three but once take the full - forced shock , then mine own electric thing , that had perhaps expired from out me . perchance , too , it would have dropped ye dead . perchance ye need it not . down lances ! and now , ye mates , i do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there -- yon three most honourable gentlemen and noblemen , my valiant harpooneers . disdain the task ? what , when the great pope washes the feet of beggars , using his tiara for ewer ? oh , my sweet cardinals ! your own condescension , that shall bend ye to it . i do not order ye ; ye will it . cut your seizings and draw the poles , ye harpooneers !\" silently obeying the order , the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons , some three feet long , held , barbs up , before him . \" stab me not with that keen steel ! cant them ; cant them over ! know ye not the goblet end ? turn up the socket ! so , so ; now , ye cup - bearers , advance . the irons ! take them ; hold them while i fill !\" forthwith , slowly going from one officer to the other , he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter . \" now , three to three , ye stand . commend the murderous chalices ! bestow them , ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league . ha ! starbuck ! but the deed is done ! yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it . drink , ye harpooneers ! drink and swear , ye men that man the deathful whaleboat \\' s bow -- death to moby dick ! god hunt us all , if we do not hunt moby dick to his death !\" the long , barbed steel goblets were lifted ; and to cries and maledictions against the white whale , the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss . starbuck paled , and turned , and shivered . once more , and finally , the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew ; when , waving his free hand to them , they all dispersed ; and ahab retired within his cabin . chapter 37 sunset . the cabin ; by the stern windows ; ahab sitting alone , and gazing out . i leave a white and turbid wake ; pale waters , paler cheeks , where \\' er i sail . the envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track ; let them ; but first i pass . yonder , by ever - brimming goblet \\' s rim , the warm waves blush like wine . the gold brow plumbs the blue . the diver sun -- slow dived from noon -- goes down ; my soul mounts up ! she wearies with her endless hill . is , then , the crown too heavy that i wear ?

preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear ! chapter 41 moby dick . i , ishmael , was one of that crew ; my shouts had gone up with the rest ; my oath had been welded with theirs ; and stronger i shouted , and more did i hammer and clinch my oath , because of the dread in my soul . a wild , mystical , sympathetical feeling was in me ; ahab \\' s quenchless feud seemed mine . with greedy ears i learned the history of that murderous monster against whom i and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and revenge . for some time past , though at intervals only , the unaccompanied , secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the sperm whale fishermen . but not all of them knew of his existence ; only a few of them , comparatively , had knowingly seen him ; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him , was small indeed . for , owing to the large number of whale - cruisers ; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference , many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes , so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch , to encounter a single news - telling sail of any sort ; the inordinate length of each separate voyage ; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home ; all these , with other circumstances , direct and indirect , long obstructed the spread through the whole world - wide whaling - fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning moby dick . it was hardly to be doubted , that several vessels reported to have encountered , at such or such a time , or on such or such a meridian , a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity , which whale , after doing great mischief to his assailants , had completely escaped them ; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption , i say , that the whale in question must have been no other than moby dick . yet as of late the sperm whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity , cunning , and malice in the monster attacked ; therefore it was , that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to moby dick ; such hunters , perhaps , for the most part , were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred , more , as it were , to the perils of the sperm whale fishery at large , than to the individual cause . in that way , mostly , the disastrous encounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded . and as for those who , previously hearing of the white whale , by chance caught sight of him ; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them , almost , as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him , as for any other whale of that species . but at length , such calamities did ensue in these assaults -- not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles , broken limbs , or devouring amputations -- but fatal to the last degree of fatality ; those repeated disastrous repulses , all accumulating and piling their terrors upon moby dick ; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters , to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come . nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate , and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters . for not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events ,-- as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi ; but , in maritime life , far more than in that of terra firma , wild rumors abound , wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to . and as the sea surpasses the land in this matter , so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life , in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there . for not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors ; but of all sailors , they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea ; face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels , but , hand to jaw , give battle to them . alone , in such remotest waters , that though you sailed a thousand miles , and passed a thousand shores , you would not come to any chiseled hearth - stone , or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun ; in such latitudes and longitudes , pursuing too such a calling as he does , the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth . no wonder , then , that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces , the outblown rumors of the white whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints , and half - formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies , which eventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears . so that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike , that few who by those rumors , at least , had heard of the white whale , few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw . but there were still other and more vital practical influences at work . not even at the present day has the original prestige of the sperm whale , as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan , died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body . there are those this day among them , who , though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale , would perhaps -- either from professional inexperience , or incompetency , or timidity , decline a contest with the sperm whale ; at any rate , there are plenty of whalemen , especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the american flag , who have never hostilely encountered the sperm whale , but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north ; seated on their hatches , these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe , to the wild , strange tales of southern whaling . nor is the pre - eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended , than on board of those prows which stem him . and as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it ; we find some book naturalists -- olassen and povelson -- declaring the sperm whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea , but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood . nor even down to so late a time as cuvier \\' s , were these or almost similar impressions effaced . for in his natural history , the baron himself affirms that at sight of the sperm whale , all fish ( sharks included ) are \" struck with the most lively terrors ,\" and \" often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death .\" and however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these ; yet in their full terribleness , even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson , the superstitious belief in them is , in some vicissitudes of their vocation , revived in the minds of the hunters . so that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him , not a few of the fishermen recalled , in reference to moby dick , the earlier days of the sperm whale fishery , when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare ; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued , yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the sperm whale was not for mortal man . that to attempt it , would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity . on this head , there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted . nevertheless , some there were , who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to moby dick ; and a still greater number who , chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely , without the specific details of any certain calamity , and without superstitious accompaniments , were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered . one of the wild suggestions referred to , as at last coming to be linked with the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined , was the unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous ; that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time . nor , credulous as such minds must have been , was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability . for as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged , even to the most erudite research ; so the hidden ways of the sperm whale when beneath the surface remain , in great part , unaccountable to his pursuers ; and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them , especially concerning the mystic modes whereby , after sounding to a great depth , he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points . it is a thing well known to both american and english whale - ships , and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by scoresby , that some whales have been captured far north in the pacific , in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland seas . nor is it to be gainsaid , that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days . hence , by inference , it has been believed by some whalemen , that the nor \\' west passage , so long a problem to man , was never a problem to the whale . so that here , in the real living experience of living men , the prodigies related in old times of the inland strello mountain in portugal ( near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface ); and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near syracuse ( whose waters were believed to have come from the holy land by an underground passage ); these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen . forced into familiarity , then , with such prodigies as these ; and knowing that after repeated , intrepid assaults , the white whale had escaped alive ; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions ; declaring moby dick not only ubiquitous , but immortal ( for immortality is but ubiquity in time ); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks , he would still swim away unharmed ; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood , such a sight would be but a ghastly deception ; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away , his unsullied jet would once more be seen . but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings , there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power . for , it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales , but , as was elsewhere thrown out -- a peculiar snow - white wrinkled forehead , and a high , pyramidical white hump . these were his prominent features ; the tokens whereby , even in the limitless , uncharted seas , he revealed his identity , at a long distance , to those who knew him . the rest of his body was so streaked , and spotted , and marbled with the same shrouded hue , that , in the end , he had gained his distinctive appellation of the white whale ; a name , indeed , literally justified by his vivid aspect , when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea , leaving a milky - way wake of creamy foam , all spangled with golden gleamings . nor was it his unwonted magnitude , nor his remarkable hue , nor yet his deformed lower jaw , that so much invested the whale with natural terror , as that unexampled , intelligent malignity which , according to specific accounts , he had over and over again evinced in his assaults . more than all , his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else . for , when swimming before his exulting pursuers , with every apparent symptom of alarm , he had several times been known to turn round suddenly , and , bearing down upon them , either stave their boats to splinters , or drive them back in consternation to their ship . already several fatalities had attended his chase . but though similar disasters , however little bruited ashore , were by no means unusual in the fishery ; yet , in most instances , such seemed the white whale \\' s infernal aforethought of ferocity , that every dismembering or death that he caused , was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent . judge , then , to what pitches of inflamed , distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled , when amid the chips of chewed boats , and the sinking limbs of torn comrades , they swam out of the white curds of the whale \\' s direful wrath into the serene , exasperating sunlight , that smiled on , as if at a birth or a bridal . his three boats stove around him , and oars and men both whirling in the eddies ; one captain , seizing the line - knife from his broken prow , had dashed at the whale , as an arkansas duellist at his foe , blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom - deep life of the whale . that captain was ahab . and then it was , that suddenly sweeping his sickle - shaped lower jaw beneath him , moby dick had reaped away ahab \\' s leg , as a mower a blade of grass in the field . no turbaned turk , no hired venetian or malay , could have smote him with more seeming malice . small reason was there to doubt , then , that ever since that almost fatal encounter , ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale , all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him , not only all his bodily woes , but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations . the white whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them , till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung . that intangible malignity which has been from the beginning ; to whose dominion even the modern christians ascribe one - half of the worlds ; which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil ;-- ahab did not fall down and worship it like them ; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale , he pitted himself , all mutilated , against it . all that most maddens and torments ; all that stirs up the lees of things ; all truth with malice in it ; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain ; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought ; all evil , to crazy ahab , were visibly personified , and made practically assailable in moby dick . he piled upon the whale \\' s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down ; and then , as if his chest had been a mortar , he burst his hot heart \\' s shell upon it . it is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment . then , in darting at the monster , knife in hand , he had but given loose to a sudden , passionate , corporal animosity ; and when he received the stroke that tore him , he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration , but nothing more . yet , when by this collision forced to turn towards home , and for long months of days and weeks , ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock , rounding in mid winter that dreary , howling patagonian cape ; then it was , that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another ; and so interfusing , made him mad . that it was only then , on the homeward voyage , after the encounter , that the final monomania seized him , seems all but certain from the fact that , at intervals during the passage , he was a raving lunatic ; and , though unlimbed of a leg , yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest , and was moreover intensified by his delirium , that his mates were forced to lace him fast , even there , as he sailed , raving in his hammock . in a strait - jacket , he swung to the mad rockings of the gales . and , when running into more sufferable latitudes , the ship , with mild stun \\' sails spread , floated across the tranquil tropics , and , to all appearances , the old man \\' s delirium seemed left behind him with the cape horn swells , and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air ; even then , when he bore that firm , collected front , however pale , and issued his calm orders once again ; and his mates thanked god the direful madness was now gone ; even then , ahab , in his hidden self , raved on . human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing . when you think it fled , it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form . ahab \\' s full lunacy subsided not , but deepeningly contracted ; like the unabated hudson , when that noble northman flows narrowly , but unfathomably through the highland gorge . but , as in his narrow - flowing monomania , not one jot of ahab \\' s broad madness had been left behind ; so in that broad madness , not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished . that before living agent , now became the living instrument . if such a furious trope may stand , his special lunacy stormed his general sanity , and carried it , and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark ; so that far from having lost his strength , ahab , to that one end , did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object . this is much ; yet ahab \\' s larger , darker , deeper part remains unhinted . but vain to popularize profundities , and all truth is profound . winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where we here stand -- however grand and wonderful , now quit it ;-- and take your way , ye nobler , sadder souls , to those vast roman halls of thermes ; where far beneath the fantastic towers of man \\' s upper earth , his root of grandeur , his whole awful essence sits in bearded state ; an antique buried beneath antiquities , and throned on torsoes ! so with a broken throne , the great gods mock that captive king ; so like a caryatid , he patient sits , upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages . wind ye down there , ye prouder , sadder souls ! question that proud , sad king ! a family likeness ! aye , he did beget ye , ye young exiled royalties ; and from your grim sire only will the old state - secret come . now , in his heart , ahab had some glimpse of this , namely : all my means are sane , my motive and my object mad . yet without power to kill , or change , or shun the fact ; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble ; in some sort , did still . but that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility , not to his will determinate . nevertheless , so well did he succeed in that dissembling , that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last , no nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved , and that to the quick , with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him . the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause . and so too , all the added moodiness which always afterwards , to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the present voyage , sat brooding on his brow . nor is it so very unlikely , that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage , on account of such dark symptoms , the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit , that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge , for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales . gnawed within and scorched without , with the infixed , unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea ; such an one , could he be found , would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes . or , if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that , yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack . but be all this as it may , certain it is , that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him , ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all - engrossing object of hunting the white whale . had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then , how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man ! they were bent on profitable cruises , the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint . he was intent on an audacious , immitigable , and supernatural revenge . here , then , was this grey - headed , ungodly old man , chasing with curses a job \\' s whale round the world , at the head of a crew , too , chiefly made up of mongrel renegades , and castaways , and cannibals -- morally enfeebled also , by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right - mindedness in starbuck , the invunerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in stubb , and the pervading mediocrity in flask . such a crew , so officered , seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge . how it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man \\' s ire -- by what evil magic their souls were possessed , that at times his hate seemed almost theirs ; the white whale as much their insufferable foe as his ; how all this came to be -- what the white whale was to them , or how to their unconscious understandings , also , in some dim , unsuspected way , he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life ,-- all this to explain , would be to dive deeper than ishmael can go . the subterranean miner that works in us all , how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting , muffled sound of his pick ? who does not feel the irresistible arm drag ? what skiff in tow of a seventy - four can stand still ? for one , i gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place ; but while yet all a - rush to encounter the whale , could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill . chapter 42 the whiteness of the whale . what the white whale was to ahab , has been hinted ; what , at times , he was to me , as yet remains unsaid . aside from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick , which could not but occasionally awaken in any man \\' s soul some alarm , there was another thought , or rather vague , nameless horror concerning him , which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest ; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it , that i almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form . it was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me . but how can i hope to explain myself here ; and yet , in some dim , random way , explain myself i must , else all these chapters might be naught . though in many natural objects , whiteness refiningly enhances beauty , as if imparting some special virtue of its own , as in marbles , japonicas , and pearls ; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue ; even the barbaric , grand old kings of pegu placing the title \" lord of the white elephants \" above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion ; and the modern kings of siam unfurling the same snow - white quadruped in the royal standard ; and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow - white charger ; and the great austrian empire , caesarian , heir to overlording rome , having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue ; and though this pre - eminence in it applies to the human race itself , giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe ; and though , besides , all this , whiteness has been even made significant of gladness , for among the romans a white stone marked a joyful day ; and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings , this same hue is made the emblem of many touching , noble things -- the innocence of brides , the benignity of age ; though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour ; though in many climes , whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge , and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk - white steeds ; though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power ; by the persian fire worshippers , the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar ; and in the greek mythologies , great jove himself being made incarnate in a snow - white bull ; and though to the noble iroquois , the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology , that spotless , faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the great spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity ; and though directly from the latin word for white , all christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture , the alb or tunic , worn beneath the cassock ; and though among the holy pomps of the romish faith , white is specially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord ; though in the vision of st . john , white robes are given to the redeemed , and the four - and - twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great - white throne , and the holy one that sitteth there white like wool ; yet for all these accumulated associations , with whatever is sweet , and honourable , and sublime , there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue , which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood . this elusive quality it is , which causes the thought of whiteness , when divorced from more kindly associations , and coupled with any object terrible in itself , to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds . witness the white bear of the poles , and the white shark of the tropics ; what but their smooth , flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are ? that ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness , even more loathsome than terrific , to the dumb gloating of their aspect . so that not the fierce - fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white - shrouded bear or shark .* * with reference to the polar bear , it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter , that it is not the whiteness , separately regarded , which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute ; for , analysed , that heightened hideousness , it might be said , only rises from the circumstance , that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love ; and hence , by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds , the polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast . but even assuming all this to be true ; yet , were it not for the whiteness , you would not have that intensified terror . as for the white shark , the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature , when beheld in his ordinary moods , strangely tallies with the same quality in the polar quadruped . this peculiarity is most vividly hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish . the romish mass for the dead begins with \" requiem eternam \" ( eternal rest ), whence requiem denominating the mass itself , and any other funeral music . now , in allusion to the white , silent stillness of death in this shark , and the mild deadliness of his habits , the french call him requin . bethink thee of the albatross , whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread , in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations ? not coleridge first threw that spell ; but god \\' s great , unflattering laureate , nature .* * i remember the first albatross i ever saw . it was during a prolonged gale , in waters hard upon the antarctic seas . from my forenoon watch below , i ascended to the overclouded deck ; and there , dashed upon the main hatches , i saw a regal , feathery thing of unspotted whiteness , and with a hooked , roman bill sublime . at intervals , it arched forth its vast archangel wings , as if to embrace some holy ark . wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it . though bodily unharmed , it uttered cries , as some king \\' s ghost in supernatural distress . through its inexpressible , strange eyes , methought i peeped to secrets which took hold of god . as abraham before the angels , i bowed myself ; the white thing was so white , its wings so wide , and in those for ever exiled waters , i had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns . long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage . i cannot tell , can only hint , the things that darted through me then . but at last i awoke ; and turning , asked a sailor what bird was this . a goney , he replied . goney ! never had heard that name before ; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore ! never ! but some time after , i learned that goney was some seaman \\' s name for albatross . so that by no possibility could coleridge \\' s wild rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine , when i saw that bird upon our deck . for neither had i then read the rhyme , nor knew the bird to be an albatross . yet , in saying this , i do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet . i assert , then , that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell ; a truth the more evinced in this , that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses ; and these i have frequently seen , but never with such emotions as when i beheld the antarctic fowl . but how had the mystic thing been caught ? whisper it not , and i will tell ; with a treacherous hook and line , as the fowl floated on the sea . at last the captain made a postman of it ; tying a lettered , leathern tally round its neck , with the ship \\' s time and place ; and then letting it escape . but i doubt not , that leathern tally , meant for man , was taken off in heaven , when the white fowl flew to join the wing - folding , the invoking , and adoring cherubim ! most famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that of the white steed of the prairies ; a magnificent milk - white charger , large - eyed , small - headed , bluff - chested , and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty , overscorning carriage . he was the elected xerxes of vast herds of wild horses , whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies . at their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light . the flashing cascade of his mane , the curving comet of his tail , invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver - beaters could have furnished him . a most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen , western world , which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when adam walked majestic as a god , bluff - browed and fearless as this mighty steed . whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains , like an ohio ; or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon , the white steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness ; in whatever aspect he presented himself , always to the bravest indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe . nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse , that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly , which so clothed him with divineness ; and that this divineness had that in it which , though commanding worship , at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror . but there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the white steed and albatross . what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye , as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin ! it is that whiteness which invests him , a thing expressed by the name he bears . the albino is as well made as other men -- has no substantive deformity -- and yet this mere aspect of all - pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion . why should this be so ? nor , in quite other aspects , does nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies , fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible . from its snowy aspect , the gauntleted ghost of the southern seas has been denominated the white squall . nor , in some historic instances , has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary . how wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in froissart , when , masked in the snowy symbol of their faction , the desperate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the market - place ! nor , in some things , does the common , hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue . it cannot well be doubted , that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer , is the marble pallor lingering there ; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world , as of mortal trepidation here . and from that pallor of the dead , we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them . nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms ; all ghosts rising in a milk - white fog -- yea , while these terrors seize us , let us add , that even the king of terrors , when personified by the evangelist , rides on his pallid horse . therefore , in his other moods , symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness , no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul . but though without dissent this point be fixed , how is mortal man to account for it ? to analyse it , would seem impossible . can we , then , by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness -- though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful , but nevertheless , is found to exert over us the same sorcery , however modified ;-- can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek ? let us try . but in a matter like this , subtlety appeals to subtlety , and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls . and though , doubtless , some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men , yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time , and therefore may not be able to recall them now . why to the man of untutored ideality , who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day , does the bare mention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long , dreary , speechless processions of slow - pacing pilgrims , down - cast and hooded with new - fallen snow ? or , to the unread , unsophisticated protestant of the middle american states , why does the passing mention of a white friar or a white nun , evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul ? or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings ( which will not wholly account for it ) that makes the white tower of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled american , than those other storied structures , its neighbors -- the byward tower , or even the bloody ? and those sublimer towers , the white mountains of new hampshire , whence , in peculiar moods , comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name , while the thought of virginia \\' s blue ridge is full of a soft , dewy , distant dreaminess ? or why , irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes , does the name of the white sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy , while that of the yellow sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves , followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets ? or , to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance , purely addressed to the fancy , why , in reading the old fairy tales of central europe , does \" the tall pale man \" of the hartz forests , whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves -- why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the blocksburg ? nor is it , altogether , the remembrance of her cathedral - toppling earthquakes ; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas ; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain ; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires , wrenched cope - stones , and crosses all adroop ( like canted yards of anchored fleets ); and her suburban avenues of house - walls lying over upon each other , as a tossed pack of cards ;-- it is not these things alone which make tearless lima , the strangest , saddest city thou can \\' st see . for lima has taken the white veil ; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe . old as pizarro , this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new ; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay ; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions . i know that , to the common apprehension , this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible ; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon , especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality . what i mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples . first : the mariner , when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands , if by night he hear the roar of breakers , starts to vigilance , and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties ; but under precisely similar circumstances , let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness -- as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him , then he feels a silent , superstitious dread ; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost ; in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings ; heart and helm they both go down ; he never rests till blue water is under him again . yet where is the mariner who will tell thee , \" sir , it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks , as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me ?\" second : to the native indian of peru , the continual sight of the snowhowdahed andes conveys naught of dread , except , perhaps , in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes , and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes . much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the west , who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow , no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness . not so the sailor , beholding the scenery of the antarctic seas ; where at times , by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air , he , shivering and half shipwrecked , instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery , views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses . but thou sayest , methinks that white - lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul ; thou surrenderest to a hypo , ishmael . tell me , why this strong young colt , foaled in some peaceful valley of vermont , far removed from all beasts of prey -- why is it that upon the sunniest day , if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him , so that he cannot even see it , but only smells its wild animal muskiness -- why will he start , snort , and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright ? there is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home , so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils ; for what knows he , this new england colt , of the black bisons of distant oregon ? no ; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute , the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world . though thousands of miles from oregon , still when he smells that savage musk , the rending , goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies , which this instant they may be trampling into dust . thus , then , the muffled rollings of a milky sea ; the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains ; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies ; all these , to ishmael , are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt ! though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints ; yet with me , as with the colt , somewhere those things must exist . though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love , the invisible spheres were formed in fright . but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness , and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul ; and more strange and far more portentous -- why , as we have seen , it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things , nay , the very veil of the christian \\' s deity ; and yet should be as it is , the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind . is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe , and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation , when beholding the white depths of the milky way ? or is it , that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour ; and at the same time the concrete of all colours ; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness , full of meaning , in a wide landscape of snows -- a colourless , all - colour of atheism from which we shrink ? and when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers , that all other earthly hues -- every stately or lovely emblazoning -- the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods ; yea , and the gilded velvets of butterflies , and the butterfly cheeks of young girls ; all these are but subtile deceits , not actually inherent in substances , but only laid on from without ; so that all deified nature absolutely paints like the harlot , whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel - house within ; and when we proceed further , and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues , the great principle of light , for ever remains white or colourless in itself , and if operating without medium upon matter , would touch all objects , even tulips and roses , with its own blank tinge -- pondering all this , the palsied universe lies before us a leper ; and like wilful travellers in lapland , who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes , so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him . and of all these things the albino whale was the symbol . wonder ye then at the fiery hunt ? chapter 43 hark ! \" hist ! did you hear that noise , cabaco ? it was the middle - watch ; a fair moonlight ; the seamen were standing in a cordon , extending from one of the fresh - water butts in the waist , to the scuttle - butt near the taffrail . in this manner , they passed the buckets to fill the scuttle - butt . standing , for the most part , on the hallowed precincts of the quarter - deck , they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet . from hand to hand , the buckets went in the deepest silence , only broken by the occasional flap of a sail , and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel . it was in the midst of this repose , that archy , one of the cordon , whose post was near the after - hatches , whispered to his neighbor , a cholo , the words above . \" hist ! did you hear that noise , cabaco ?\" \" take the bucket , will ye , archy ? what noise d \\' ye mean ?\" \" there it is again -- under the hatches -- don \\' t you hear it -- a cough -- it sounded like a cough .\" \" cough be damned ! pass along that return bucket .\" \" there again -- there it is !-- it sounds like two or three sleepers turning over , now !\" \" caramba ! have done , shipmate , will ye ? it \\' s the three soaked biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye -- nothing else . look to the bucket !\" \" say what ye will , shipmate ; i \\' ve sharp ears .\" \" aye , you are the chap , ain \\' t ye , that heard the hum of the old quakeress \\' s knitting - needles fifty miles at sea from nantucket ; you \\' re the chap .\" \" grin away ; we \\' ll see what turns up . hark ye , cabaco , there is somebody down in the after - hold that has not yet been seen on deck ; and i suspect our old mogul knows something of it too . i heard stubb tell flask , one morning watch , that there was something of that sort in the wind .\" \" tish ! the bucket !\" chapter 44 the chart . had you followed captain ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew , you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom , and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts , spread them before him on his screwed - down table . then seating himself before it , you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye ; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank . at intervals , he would refer to piles of old log - books beside him , wherein were set down the seasons and places in which , on various former voyages of various ships , sperm whales had been captured or seen . while thus employed , the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head , continually rocked with the motion of the ship , and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow , till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts , some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead . but it was not this night in particular that , in the solitude of his cabin , ahab thus pondered over his charts . almost every night they were brought out ; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced , and others were substituted . for with the charts of all four oceans before him , ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies , with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul . now , to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans , it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet . but not so did it seem to ahab , who knew the sets of all tides and currents ; and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale \\' s food ; and , also , calling to mind the regular , ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes ; could arrive at reasonable surmises , almost approaching to certainties , concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey . so assured , indeed , is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale \\' s resorting to given waters , that many hunters believe that , could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world ; were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated , then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring - shoals or the flights of swallows . on this hint , attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale .* * since the above was written , the statement is happily borne out by an official circular , issued by lieutenant maury , of the national observatory , washington , april 16th , 1851 . by that circular , it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion ; and portions of it are presented in the circular . \" this chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude ; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months ; and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines ; one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district , and the two others to show the number of days in which whales , sperm or right , have been seen .\" besides , when making a passage from one feeding - ground to another , the sperm whales , guided by some infallible instinct -- say , rather , secret intelligence from the deity -- mostly swim in veins , as they are called ; continuing their way along a given ocean - line with such undeviating exactitude , that no ship ever sailed her course , by any chart , with one tithe of such marvellous precision . though , in these cases , the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor \\' s parallel , and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable , straight wake , yet the arbitrary vein in which at these times he is said to swim , generally embraces some few miles in width ( more or less , as the vein is presumed to expand or contract ); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale - ship \\' s mast - heads , when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone . the sum is , that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path , migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for . and hence not only at substantiated times , upon well known separate feeding - grounds , could ahab hope to encounter his prey ; but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could , by his art , so place and time himself on his way , as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting . there was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme . but not so in the reality , perhaps . though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds , yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year , say , will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season ; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true . in general , the same remark , only within a less wide limit , applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured , aged sperm whales . so that though moby dick had in a former year been seen , for example , on what is called the seychelle ground in the indian ocean , or volcano bay on the japanese coast ; yet it did not follow , that were the pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season , she would infallibly encounter him there . so , too , with some other feeding grounds , where he had at times revealed himself . but all these seemed only his casual stopping - places and ocean - inns , so to speak , not his places of prolonged abode . and where ahab \\' s chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of , allusion has only been made to whatever way - side , antecedent , extra prospects were his , ere a particular set time or place were attained , when all possibilities would become probabilities , and , as ahab fondly thought , every possibility the next thing to a certainty . that particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase -- the season - on - the - line . for there and then , for several consecutive years , moby dick had been periodically descried , lingering in those waters for awhile , as the sun , in its annual round , loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the zodiac . there it was , too , that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place ; there the waves were storied with his deeds ; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance . but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt , he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned , however flattering it might be to those hopes ; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest . now , the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginning of the season - on - the - line . no possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards , double cape horn , and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial pacific in time to cruise there . therefore , he must wait for the next ensuing season . yet the premature hour of the pequod \\' s sailing had , perhaps , been correctly selected by ahab , with a view to this very complexion of things . because , an interval of three hundred and sixty - five days and nights was before him ; an interval which , instead of impatiently enduring ashore , he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt ; if by chance the white whale , spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding - grounds , should turn up his wrinkled brow off the persian gulf , or in the bengal bay , or china seas , or in any other waters haunted by his race . so that monsoons , pampas , nor \\'- westers , harmattans , trades ; any wind but the levanter and simoon , might blow moby dick into the devious zig - zag world - circle of the pequod \\' s circumnavigating wake . but granting all this ; yet , regarded discreetly and coolly , seems it not but a mad idea , this ; that in the broad boundless ocean , one solitary whale , even if encountered , should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter , even as a white - bearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of constantinople ? yes . for the peculiar snow - white brow of moby dick , and his snow - white hump , could not but be unmistakable . and have i not tallied the whale , ahab would mutter to himself , as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries -- tallied him , and shall he escape ? his broad fins are bored , and scalloped out like a lost sheep \\' s ear ! and here , his mad mind would run on in a breathless race ; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him ; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength . ah , god ! what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire . he sleeps with clenched hands ; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms . often , when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night , which , resuming his own intense thoughts through the day , carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies , and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain , till the very throbbing of his life - spot became insufferable anguish ; and when , as was sometimes the case , these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base , and a chasm seemed opening in him , from which forked flames and lightnings shot up , and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them ; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him , a wild cry would be heard through the ship ; and with glaring eyes ahab would burst from his state room , as though escaping from a bed that was on fire . yet these , perhaps , instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness , or fright at his own resolve , were but the plainest tokens of its intensity . for , at such times , crazy ahab , the scheming , unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale ; this ahab that had gone to his hammock , was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again . the latter was the eternal , living principle or soul in him ; and in sleep , being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind , which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent , it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing , of which , for the time , it was no longer an integral . but as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul , therefore it must have been that , in ahab \\' s case , yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose ; that purpose , by its own sheer inveteracy of will , forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of self - assumed , independent being of its own . nay , could grimly live and burn , while the common vitality to which it was conjoined , fled horror - stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth . therefore , the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes , when what seemed ahab rushed from his room , was for the time but a vacated thing , a formless somnambulistic being , a ray of living light , to be sure , but without an object to colour , and therefore a blankness in itself . god help thee , old man , thy thoughts have created a creature in thee ; and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a prometheus ; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever ; that vulture the very creature he creates . chapter 45 the affidavit . so far as what there may be of a narrative in this book ; and , indeed , as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales , the foregoing chapter , in its earlier part , is as important a one as will be found in this volume ; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon , in order to be adequately understood , and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds , as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair . i care not to perform this part of my task methodically ; but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items , practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman ; and from these citations , i take it -- the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself . first : i have personally known three instances where a whale , after receiving a harpoon , has effected a complete escape ; and , after an interval ( in one instance of three years ), has been again struck by the same hand , and slain ; when the two irons , both marked by the same private cypher , have been taken from the body . in the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons ; and i think it may have been something more than that ; the man who darted them happening , in the interval , to go in a trading ship on a voyage to africa , went ashore there , joined a discovery party , and penetrated far into the interior , where he travelled for a period of nearly two years , often endangered by serpents , savages , tigers , poisonous miasmas , with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions . meanwhile , the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels ; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe , brushing with its flanks all the coasts of africa ; but to no purpose . this man and this whale again came together , and the one vanquished the other . i say i , myself , have known three instances similar to this ; that is in two of them i saw the whales struck ; and , upon the second attack , saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them , afterwards taken from the dead fish . in the three - year instance , it so fell out that i was in the boat both times , first and last , and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale \\' s eye , which i had observed there three years previous . i say three years , but i am pretty sure it was more than that . here are three instances , then , which i personally know the truth of ; but i have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach . secondly : it is well known in the sperm whale fishery , however ignorant the world ashore may be of it , that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable . why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales ; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be , they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him , and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil . no : the reason was this : that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about rinaldo rinaldini , insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea , without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance . like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man , they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street , lest if they pursued the acquaintance further , they might receive a summary thump for their presumption . but not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrity -- nay , you may call it an ocean - wide renown ; not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death , but he was admitted into all the rights , privileges , and distinctions of a name ; had as much a name indeed as cambyses or caesar . was it not so , o timor tom ! thou famed leviathan , scarred like an iceberg , who so long did \\' st lurk in the oriental straits of that name , whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of ombay ? was it not so , o new zealand jack ! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the tattoo land ? was it not so , o morquan ! king of japan , whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow - white cross against the sky ? was it not so , o don miguel ! thou chilian whale , marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back ! in plain prose , here are four whales as well known to the students of cetacean history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar . but this is not all . new zealand tom and don miguel , after at various times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels , were finally gone in quest of , systematically hunted out , chased and killed by valiant whaling captains , who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view , as in setting out through the narragansett woods , captain butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage annawon , the headmost warrior of the indian king philip . i do not know where i can find a better place than just here , to make mention of one or two other things , which to me seem important , as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the white whale , more especially the catastrophe . for this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error . so ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world , that without some hints touching the plain facts , historical and otherwise , of the fishery , they might scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable , or still worse and more detestable , a hideous and intolerable allegory . first : though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery , yet they have nothing like a fixed , vivid conception of those perils , and the frequency with which they recur . one reason perhaps is , that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery , ever finds a public record at home , however transient and immediately forgotten that record . do you suppose that that poor fellow there , who this moment perhaps caught by the whale - line off the coast of new guinea , is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan -- do you suppose that that poor fellow \\' s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to - morrow at your breakfast ? no : because the mails are very irregular between here and new guinea . in fact , did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea ? yet i tell you that upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific , among many others we spoke thirty different ships , every one of which had had a death by a whale , some of them more than one , and three that had each lost a boat \\' s crew . for god \\' s sake , be economical with your lamps and candles ! not a gallon you burn , but at least one drop of man \\' s blood was spilled for it . secondly : people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power ; but i have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two - fold enormousness , they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness ; when , i declare upon my soul , i had no more idea of being facetious than moses , when he wrote the history of the plagues of egypt . but fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own . that point is this : the sperm whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful , knowing , and judiciously malicious , as with direct aforethought to stave in , utterly destroy , and sink a large ship ; and what is more , the sperm whale has done it . first : in the year 1820 the ship essex , captain pollard , of nantucket , was cruising in the pacific ocean . one day she saw spouts , lowered her boats , and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales . ere long , several of the whales were wounded ; when , suddenly , a very large whale escaping from the boats , issued from the shoal , and bore directly down upon the ship . dashing his forehead against her hull , he so stove her in , that in less than \" ten minutes \" she settled down and fell over . not a surviving plank of her has been seen since . after the severest exposure , part of the crew reached the land in their boats . being returned home at last , captain pollard once more sailed for the pacific in command of another ship , but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers ; for the second time his ship was utterly lost , and forthwith forswearing the sea , he has never tempted it since . at this day captain pollard is a resident of nantucket . i have seen owen chace , who was chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy ; i have read his plain and faithful narrative ; i have conversed with his son ; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe .* * the following are extracts from chace \\' s narrative : \" every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations ; he made two several attacks upon the ship , at a short interval between them , both of which , according to their direction , were calculated to do us the most injury , by being made ahead , and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock ; to effect which , the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary . his aspect was most horrible , and such as indicated resentment and fury . he came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered , and in which we had struck three of his companions , as if fired with revenge for their sufferings .\" again : \" at all events , the whole circumstances taken together , all happening before my own eyes , and producing , at the time , impressions in my mind of decided , calculating mischief , on the part of the whale ( many of which impressions i cannot now recall ), induce me to be satisfied that i am correct in my opinion .\" here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship , during a black night an open boat , when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore . \" the dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing ; the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest , or dashed upon hidden rocks , with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation , seemed scarcely entitled to a moment \\' s thought ; the dismal looking wreck , and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale , wholly engrossed my reflections , until day again made its appearance .\" in another place -- p . 45 ,-- he speaks of \" the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal .\" secondly : the ship union , also of nantucket , was in the year 1807 totally lost off the azores by a similar onset , but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter , though from the whale hunters i have now and then heard casual allusions to it . thirdly : some eighteen or twenty years ago commodore j ---, then commanding an american sloop - of - war of the first class , happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains , on board a nantucket ship in the harbor of oahu , sandwich islands . conversation turning upon whales , the commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present . he peremptorily denied for example , that any whale could so smite his stout sloop - of - war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful . very good ; but there is more coming . some weeks after , the commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for valparaiso . but he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale , that begged a few moments \\' confidential business with him . that business consisted in fetching the commodore \\' s craft such a thwack , that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair . i am not superstitious , but i consider the commodore \\' s interview with that whale as providential . was not saul of tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright ? i tell you , the sperm whale will stand no nonsense . i will now refer you to langsdorff \\' s voyages for a little circumstance in point , peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof . langsdorff , you must know by the way , was attached to the russian admiral krusenstern \\' s famous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century . captain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter : \" by the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail , and the next day we were out in the open sea , on our way to ochotsh . the weather was very clear and fine , but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing . for some days we had very little wind ; it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up . an uncommon large whale , the body of which was larger than the ship itself , lay almost at the surface of the water , but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship , which was in full sail , was almost upon him , so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him . we were thus placed in the most imminent danger , as this gigantic creature , setting up its back , raised the ship three feet at least out of the water . the masts reeled , and the sails fell altogether , while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck , concluding that we had struck upon some rock ; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity . captain d \\' wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock , but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured .\" now , the captain d \\' wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question , is a new englander , who , after a long life of unusual adventures as a sea - captain , this day resides in the village of dorchester near boston . i have the honour of being a nephew of his . i have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in langsdorff . he substantiates every word . the ship , however , was by no means a large one : a russian craft built on the siberian coast , and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home . in that up and down manly book of old - fashioned adventure , so full , too , of honest wonders -- the voyage of lionel wafer , one of ancient dampier \\' s old chums -- i found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from langsdorff , that i cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example , if such be needed . lionel , it seems , was on his way to \" john ferdinando ,\" as he calls the modern juan fernandes . \" in our way thither ,\" he says , \" about four o \\' clock in the morning , when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the main of america , our ship felt a terrible shock , which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think ; but every one began to prepare for death . and , indeed , the shock was so sudden and violent , that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock ; but when the amazement was a little over , we cast the lead , and sounded , but found no ground . .... the suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages , and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks . captain davis , who lay with his head on a gun , was thrown out of his cabin !\" lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake , and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake , somewhere about that time , did actually do great mischief along the spanish land . but i should not much wonder if , in the darkness of that early hour of the morning , the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath . i might proceed with several more examples , one way or another known to me , of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale . in more than one instance , he has been known , not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships , but to pursue the ship itself , and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks . the english ship pusie hall can tell a story on that head ; and , as for his strength , let me say , that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have , in a calm , been transferred to the ship , and secured there ; the whale towing her great hull through the water , as a horse walks off with a cart . again , it is very often observed that , if the sperm whale , once struck , is allowed time to rally , he then acts , not so often with blind rage , as with wilful , deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers ; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character , that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth , and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes . but i must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration ; a remarkable and most significant one , by which you will not fail to see , that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day , but that these marvels ( like all marvels ) are mere repetitions of the ages ; so that for the millionth time we say amen with solomon -- verily there is nothing new under the sun . in the sixth christian century lived procopius , a christian magistrate of constantinople , in the days when justinian was emperor and belisarius general . as many know , he wrote the history of his own times , a work every way of uncommon value . by the best authorities , he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian , except in some one or two particulars , not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned . now , in this history of his , procopius mentions that , during the term of his prefecture at constantinople , a great sea - monster was captured in the neighboring propontis , or sea of marmora , after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years . a fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid . nor is there any reason it should be . of what precise species this sea - monster was , is not mentioned . but as he destroyed ships , as well as for other reasons , he must have been a whale ; and i am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale . and i will tell you why . for a long time i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it . even now i am certain that those seas are not , and perhaps never can be , in the present constitution of things , a place for his habitual gregarious resort . but further investigations have recently proved to me , that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the mediterranean . i am told , on good authority , that on the barbary coast , a commodore davis of the british navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale . now , as a vessel of war readily passes through the dardanelles , hence a sperm whale could , by the same route , pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis . in the propontis , as far as i can learn , none of that peculiar substance called brit is to be found , the aliment of the right whale . but i have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale -- squid or cuttle - fish -- lurks at the bottom of that sea , because large creatures , but by no means the largest of that sort , have been found at its surface . if , then , you properly put these statements together , and reason upon them a bit , you will clearly perceive that , according to all human reasoning , procopius \\' s sea - monster , that for half a century stove the ships of a roman emperor , must in all probability have been a sperm whale . chapter 46 surmises . though , consumed with the hot fire of his purpose , ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of moby dick ; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion ; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman \\' s ways , altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage . or at least if this were otherwise , there were not wanting other motives much more influential with him . it would be refining too much , perhaps , even considering his monomania , to hint that his vindictiveness towards the white whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales , and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted . but if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable , there were still additional considerations which , though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion , yet were by no means incapable of swaying him . to accomplish his object ahab must use tools ; and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon , men are most apt to get out of order . he knew , for example , that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over starbuck , yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership ; for to the purely spiritual , the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation . starbuck \\' s body and starbuck \\' s coerced will were ahab \\' s , so long as ahab kept his magnet at starbuck \\' s brain ; still he knew that for all this the chief mate , in his soul , abhorred his captain \\' s quest , and could he , would joyfully disintegrate himself from it , or even frustrate it . it might be that a long interval would elapse ere the white whale was seen . during that long interval starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captain \\' s leadership , unless some ordinary , prudential , circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him . not only that , but the subtle insanity of ahab respecting moby dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that , for the present , the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it ; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background ( for few men \\' s courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action ); that when they stood their long night watches , his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than moby dick . for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest ; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable -- they live in the varying outer weather , and they inhale its fickleness -- and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit , however promissory of life and passion in the end , it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash . nor was ahab unmindful of another thing . in times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations ; but such times are evanescent . the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man , thought ahab , is sordidness . granting that the white whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew , and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight - errantism in them , still , while for the love of it they give chase to moby dick , they must also have food for their more common , daily appetites . for even the high lifted and chivalric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre , without committing burglaries , picking pockets , and gaining other pious perquisites by the way . had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object -- that final and romantic object , too many would have turned from in disgust . i will not strip these men , thought ahab , of all hopes of cash -- aye , cash . they may scorn cash now ; but let some months go by , and no perspective promise of it to them , and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them , this same cash would soon cashier ahab . nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to ahab personally . having impulsively , it is probable , and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the pequod \\' s voyage , ahab was now entirely conscious that , in so doing , he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation ; and with perfect impunity , both moral and legal , his crew if so disposed , and to that end competent , could refuse all further obedience to him , and even violently wrest from him the command . from even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation , and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground , ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself . that protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand , backed by a heedful , closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to . for all these reasons then , and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here , ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural , nominal purpose of the pequod \\' s voyage ; observe all customary usages ; and not only that , but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession . be all this as it may , his voice was now often heard hailing the three mast - heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look - out , and not omit reporting even a porpoise . this vigilance was not long without reward . chapter 47 the mat - maker . it was a cloudy , sultry afternoon ; the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks , or vacantly gazing over into the lead - coloured waters . queequeg and i were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword - mat , for an additional lashing to our boat . so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene , and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air , that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self . i was the attendant or page of queequeg , while busy at the mat . as i kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp , using my own hand for the shuttle , and as queequeg , standing sideways , ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads , and idly looking off upon the water , carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn : i say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea , only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword , that it seemed as if this were the loom of time , and i myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the fates . there lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single , ever returning , unchanging vibration , and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own . this warp seemed necessity ; and here , thought i , with my own hand i ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads . meantime , queequeg \\' s impulsive , indifferent sword , sometimes hitting the woof slantingly , or crookedly , or strongly , or weakly , as the case might be ; and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric ; this savage \\' s sword , thought i , which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof ; this easy , indifferent sword must be chance -- aye , chance , free will , and necessity -- nowise incompatible -- all interweavingly working together . the straight warp of necessity , not to be swerved from its ultimate course -- its every alternating vibration , indeed , only tending to that ; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads ; and chance , though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity , and sideways in its motions directed by free will , though thus prescribed to by both , chance by turns rules either , and has the last featuring blow at events . thus we were weaving and weaving away when i started at a sound so strange , long drawn , and musically wild and unearthly , that the ball of free will dropped from my hand , and i stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing . high aloft in the cross - trees was that mad gay - header , tashtego . his body was reaching eagerly forward , his hand stretched out like a wand , and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries . to be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas , from hundreds of whalemen \\' s look - outs perched as high in the air ; but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from tashtego the indian \\' s . as he stood hovering over you half suspended in air , so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon , you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of fate , and by those wild cries announcing their coming . \" there she blows ! there ! there ! there ! she blows ! she blows !\" \" where - away ?\" \" on the lee - beam , about two miles off ! a school of them !\" instantly all was commotion . the sperm whale blows as a clock ticks , with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity . and thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus . \" there go flukes !\" was now the cry from tashtego ; and the whales disappeared . \" quick , steward !\" cried ahab . \" time ! time !\" dough - boy hurried below , glanced at the watch , and reported the exact minute to ahab . the ship was now kept away from the wind , and she went gently rolling before it . tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward , we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows . for that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm whale when , sounding with his head in one direction , he nevertheless , while concealed beneath the surface , mills round , and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter -- this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action ; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by tashtego had been in any way alarmed , or indeed knew at all of our vicinity . one of the men selected for shipkeepers -- that is , those not appointed to the boats , by this time relieved the indian at the main - mast head . the sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down ; the line tubs were fixed in their places ; the cranes were thrust out ; the mainyard was backed , and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs . outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail , while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale . so look the long line of man - of - war \\' s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy \\' s ship . but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale . with a start all glared at dark ahab , who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air . chapter 48 the first lowering . the phantoms , for so they then seemed , were flitting on the other side of the deck , and , with a noiseless celerity , were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there . this boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats , though technically called the captain \\' s , on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter . the figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart , with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel - like lips . a rumpled chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him , with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff . but strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban , the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head . less swart in aspect , the companions of this figure were of that vivid , tiger - yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the manillas ;-- a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty , and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil , their lord , whose counting - room they suppose to be elsewhere . while yet the wondering ship \\' s company were gazing upon these strangers , ahab cried out to the white - turbaned old man at their head , \" all ready there , fedallah ?\" \" ready ,\" was the half - hissed reply . \" lower away then ; d \\' ye hear ?\" shouting across the deck . \" lower away there , i say .\" such was the thunder of his voice , that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail ; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks ; with a wallow , the three boats dropped into the sea ; while , with a dexterous , off - handed daring , unknown in any other vocation , the sailors , goat - like , leaped down the rolling ship \\' s side into the tossed boats below . hardly had they pulled out from under the ship \\' s lee , when a fourth keel , coming from the windward side , pulled round under the stern , and showed the five strangers rowing ahab , who , standing erect in the stern , loudly hailed starbuck , stubb , and flask , to spread themselves widely , so as to cover a large expanse of water . but with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart fedallah and his crew , the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command . \" captain ahab ?--\" said starbuck . \" spread yourselves ,\" cried ahab ; \" give way , all four boats . thou , flask , pull out more to leeward !\" \" aye , aye , sir ,\" cheerily cried little king - post , sweeping round his great steering oar . \" lay back !\" addressing his crew . \" there !-- there !-- there again ! there she blows right ahead , boys !-- lay back !\" \" never heed yonder yellow boys , archy .\" \" oh , i don \\' t mind \\' em , sir ,\" said archy ; \" i knew it all before now . didn \\' t i hear \\' em in the hold ? and didn \\' t i tell cabaco here of it ? what say ye , cabaco ? they are stowaways , mr . flask .\" \" pull , pull , my fine hearts - alive ; pull , my children ; pull , my little ones ,\" drawlingly and soothingly sighed stubb to his crew , some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness . \" why don \\' t you break your backbones , my boys ? what is it you stare at ? those chaps in yonder boat ? tut ! they are only five more hands come to help us -- never mind from where -- the more the merrier . pull , then , do pull ; never mind the brimstone -- devils are good fellows enough . so , so ; there you are now ; that \\' s the stroke for a thousand pounds ; that \\' s the stroke to sweep the stakes ! hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil , my heroes ! three cheers , men -- all hearts alive ! easy , easy ; don \\' t be in a hurry -- don \\' t be in a hurry . why don \\' t you snap your oars , you rascals ? bite something , you dogs ! so , so , so , then :-- softly , softly ! that \\' s it -- that \\' s it ! long and strong . give way there , give way ! the devil fetch ye , ye ragamuffin rapscallions ; ye are all asleep . stop snoring , ye sleepers , and pull . pull , will ye ? pull , can \\' t ye ? pull , won \\' t ye ? why in the name of gudgeons and ginger - cakes don \\' t ye pull ?-- pull and break something ! pull , and start your eyes out ! here !\" whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle ; \" every mother \\' s son of ye draw his knife , and pull with the blade between his teeth . that \\' s it -- that \\' s it . now ye do something ; that looks like it , my steel - bits . start her -- start her , my silver - spoons ! start her , marling - spikes !\" stubb \\' s exordium to his crew is given here at large , because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general , and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing . but you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation . not at all ; and therein consisted his chief peculiarity . he would say the most terrific things to his crew , in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury , and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun , that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life , and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing . besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself , so loungingly managed his steering - oar , and so broadly gaped -- open - mouthed at times -- that the mere sight of such a yawning commander , by sheer force of contrast , acted like a charm upon the crew . then again , stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists , whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous , as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them . in obedience to a sign from ahab , starbuck was now pulling obliquely across stubb \\' s bow ; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other , stubb hailed the mate . \" mr . starbuck ! larboard boat there , ahoy ! a word with ye , sir , if ye please !\" \" halloa !\" returned starbuck , turning round not a single inch as he spoke ; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew ; his face set like a flint from stubb \\' s . \" what think ye of those yellow boys , sir ! \" smuggled on board , somehow , before the ship sailed . ( strong , strong , boys !)\" in a whisper to his crew , then speaking out loud again : \" a sad business , mr . stubb ! ( seethe her , seethe her , my lads !) but never mind , mr . stubb , all for the best . let all your crew pull strong , come what will . ( spring , my men , spring !) there \\' s hogsheads of sperm ahead , mr . stubb , and that \\' s what ye came for . ( pull , my boys !) sperm , sperm \\' s the play ! this at least is duty ; duty and profit hand in hand .\" \" aye , aye , i thought as much ,\" soliloquized stubb , when the boats diverged , \" as soon as i clapt eye on \\' em , i thought so . aye , and that \\' s what he went into the after hold for , so often , as dough - boy long suspected . they were hidden down there . the white whale \\' s at the bottom of it . well , well , so be it ! can \\' t be helped ! all right ! give way , men ! it ain \\' t the white whale to - day ! give way !\" now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck , this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship \\' s company ; but archy \\' s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them , though indeed not credited then , this had in some small measure prepared them for the event . it took off the extreme edge of their wonder ; and so what with all this and stubb \\' s confident way of accounting for their appearance , they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings ; though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark ahab \\' s precise agency in the matter from the beginning . for me , i silently recalled the mysterious shadows i had seen creeping on board the pequod during the dim nantucket dawn , as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable elijah . meantime , ahab , out of hearing of his officers , having sided the furthest to windward , was still ranging ahead of the other boats ; a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him . those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone ; like five trip - hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength , which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a mississippi steamer . as for fedallah , who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar , he had thrown aside his black jacket , and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale , clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon ; while at the other end of the boat ahab , with one arm , like a fencer \\' s , thrown half backward into the air , as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ; ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him . all at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed , while the boat \\' s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked . boat and crew sat motionless on the sea . instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way . the whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue , thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement , though from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it . \" every man look out along his oars !\" cried starbuck . \" thou , queequeg , stand up !\" nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow , the savage stood erect there , and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried . likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale , starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft , and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea . not very far distant flask \\' s boat was also lying breathlessly still ; its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead , a stout sort of post rooted in the keel , and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform . it is used for catching turns with the whale line . its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man \\' s hand , and standing upon such a base as that , flask seemed perched at the mast - head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks . but little king - post was small and short , and at the same time little king - post was full of a large and tall ambition , so that this loggerhead stand - point of his did by no means satisfy king - post . \" i can \\' t see three seas off ; tip us up an oar there , and let me on to that .\" upon this , daggoo , with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way , swiftly slid aft , and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal . \" good a mast - head as any , sir . will you mount ?\" \" that i will , and thank ye very much , my fine fellow ; only i wish you fifty feet taller .\" whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat , the gigantic negro , stooping a little , presented his flat palm to flask \\' s foot , and then putting flask \\' s hand on his hearse - plumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss , with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders . and here was flask now standing , daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by . at any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat , even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross - running seas . still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself , under such circumstances . but the sight of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo was yet more curious ; for sustaining himself with a cool , indifferent , easy , unthought of , barbaric majesty , the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form . on his broad back , flaxen - haired flask seemed a snow - flake . the bearer looked nobler than the rider . though truly vivacious , tumultuous , ostentatious little flask would now and then stamp with impatience ; but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro \\' s lordly chest . so have i seen passion and vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth , but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that . meanwhile stubb , the third mate , betrayed no such far - gazing solicitudes . the whales might have made one of their regular soundings , not a temporary dive from mere fright ; and if that were the case , stubb , as his wont in such cases , it seems , was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe . he withdrew it from his hatband , where he always wore it aslant like a feather . he loaded it , and rammed home the loading with his thumb - end ; but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand , when tashtego , his harpooneer , whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars , suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat , crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry , \" down , down all , and give way !-- there they are !\" to a landsman , no whale , nor any sign of a herring , would have been visible at that moment ; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water , and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it , and suffusingly blowing off to leeward , like the confused scud from white rolling billows . the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled , as it were , like the air over intensely heated plates of iron . beneath this atmospheric waving and curling , and partially beneath a thin layer of water , also , the whales were swimming . seen in advance of all the other indications , the puffs of vapour they spouted , seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders . all four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air . but it bade fair to outstrip them ; it flew on and on , as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills . \" pull , pull , my good boys ,\" said starbuck , in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men ; while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow , almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses . he did not say much to his crew , though , nor did his crew say anything to him . only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers , now harsh with command , now soft with entreaty . how different the loud little king - post . \" sing out and say something , my hearties . roar and pull , my thunderbolts ! beach me , beach me on their black backs , boys ; only do that for me , and i \\' ll sign over to you my martha \\' s vineyard plantation , boys ; including wife and children , boys . lay me on -- lay me on ! o lord , lord ! but i shall go stark , staring mad ! see ! see that white water !\" and so shouting , he pulled his hat from his head , and stamped up and down on it ; then picking it up , flirted it far off upon the sea ; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat \\' s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie . \" look at that chap now ,\" philosophically drawled stubb , who , with his unlighted short pipe , mechanically retained between his teeth , at a short distance , followed after --\" he \\' s got fits , that flask has . fits ? yes , give him fits -- that \\' s the very word -- pitch fits into \\' em . merrily , merrily , hearts - alive . pudding for supper , you know ;-- merry \\' s the word . pull , babes -- pull , sucklings -- pull , all . but what the devil are you hurrying about ? softly , softly , and steadily , my men . only pull , and keep pulling ; nothing more . crack all your backbones , and bite your knives in two -- that \\' s all . take it easy -- why don \\' t ye take it easy , i say , and burst all your livers and lungs !\" but what it was that inscrutable ahab said to that tiger - yellow crew of his -- these were words best omitted here ; for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land . only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words , when , with tornado brow , and eyes of red murder , and foam - glued lips , ahab leaped after his prey . meanwhile , all the boats tore on . the repeated specific allusions of flask to \" that whale ,\" as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat \\' s bow with its tail -- these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life - like , that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder . but this was against all rule ; for the oarsmen must put out their eyes , and ram a skewer through their necks ; usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears , and no limbs but arms , in these critical moments . it was a sight full of quick wonder and awe ! the vast swells of the omnipotent sea ; the surging , hollow roar they made , as they rolled along the eight gunwales , like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling - green ; the brief suspended agony of the boat , as it would tip for an instant on the knife - like edge of the sharper waves , that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two ; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows ; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill ; the headlong , sled - like slide down its other side ;-- all these , with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers , and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen , with the wondrous sight of the ivory pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails , like a wild hen after her screaming brood ;-- all this was thrilling . not the raw recruit , marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle ; not the dead man \\' s ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world ;-- neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does , who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed , churned circle of the hunted sperm whale . the dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible , owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud - shadows flung upon the sea . the jets of vapour no longer blended , but tilted everywhere to right and left ; the whales seemed separating their wakes . the boats were pulled more apart ; starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward . our sail was now set , and , with the still rising wind , we rushed along ; the boat going with such madness through the water , that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row - locks . soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist ; neither ship nor boat to be seen . \" give way , men ,\" whispered starbuck , drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail ; \" there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes . there \\' s white water again !-- close to ! spring !\" soon after , two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast ; but hardly were they overheard , when with a lightning - like hurtling whisper starbuck said : \" stand up !\" and queequeg , harpoon in hand , sprang to his feet . though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead , yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat , they knew that the imminent instant had come ; they heard , too , an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter . meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist , the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents . \" that \\' s his hump . there , there , give it to him !\" whispered starbuck . a short rushing sound leaped out of the boat ; it was the darted iron of queequeg . then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern , while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge ; the sail collapsed and exploded ; a gush of scalding vapour shot up near by ; something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us . the whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter - skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall . squall , whale , and harpoon had all blended together ; and the whale , merely grazed by the iron , escaped . though completely swamped , the boat was nearly unharmed . swimming round it we picked up the floating oars , and lashing them across the gunwale , tumbled back to our places . there we sat up to our knees in the sea , the water covering every rib and plank , so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean . the wind increased to a howl ; the waves dashed their bucklers together ; the whole squall roared , forked , and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie , in which , unconsumed , we were burning ; immortal in these jaws of death ! in vain we hailed the other boats ; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm . meanwhile the driving scud , rack , and mist , grew darker with the shadows of night ; no sign of the ship could be seen . the rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat . the oars were useless as propellers , performing now the office of life - preservers . so , cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg , after many failures starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern ; then stretching it on a waif pole , handed it to queequeg as the standard - bearer of this forlorn hope . there , then , he sat , holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness . there , then , he sat , the sign and symbol of a man without faith , hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair . wet , drenched through , and shivering cold , despairing of ship or boat , we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on . the mist still spread over the sea , the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat . suddenly queequeg started to his feet , hollowing his hand to his ear . we all heard a faint creaking , as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm . the sound came nearer and nearer ; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge , vague form . affrighted , we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view , bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length . floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat , as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship \\' s bows like a chip at the base of a cataract ; and then the vast hull rolled over it , and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern . again we swam for it , were dashed against it by the seas , and were at last taken up and safely landed on board . ere the squall came close to , the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time . the ship had given us up , but was still cruising , if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing ,-- an oar or a lance pole . chapter 49 the hyena . there are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke , though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns , and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody \\' s expense but his own . however , nothing dispirits , and nothing seems worth while disputing . he bolts down all events , all creeds , and beliefs , and persuasions , all hard things visible and invisible , never mind how knobby ; as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints . and as for small difficulties and worryings , prospects of sudden disaster , peril of life and limb ; all these , and death itself , seem to him only sly , good - natured hits , and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker . that odd sort of wayward mood i am speaking of , comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation ; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness , so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous , now seems but a part of the general joke . there is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial , desperado philosophy ; and with it i now regarded this whole voyage of the pequod , and the great white whale its object . \" queequeg ,\" said i , when they had dragged me , the last man , to the deck , and i was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water ; \" queequeg , my fine friend , does this sort of thing often happen ?\" without much emotion , though soaked through just like me , he gave me to understand that such things did often happen . \" mr . stubb ,\" said i , turning to that worthy , who , buttoned up in his oil - jacket , was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain ; \" mr . stubb , i think i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met , our chief mate , mr . starbuck , is by far the most careful and prudent . i suppose then , that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman \\' s discretion ?\" \" certain . i \\' ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off cape horn .\" \" mr . flask ,\" said i , turning to little king - post , who was standing close by ; \" you are experienced in these things , and i am not . will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery , mr . flask , for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back - foremost into death \\' s jaws ?\" \" can \\' t you twist that smaller ?\" said flask . \" yes , that \\' s the law . i should like to see a boat \\' s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost . ha , ha ! the whale would give them squint for squint , mind that !\" here then , from three impartial witnesses , i had a deliberate statement of the entire case . considering , therefore , that squalls and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep , were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life ; considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale i must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat -- oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings ; considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to starbuck \\' s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall , and considering that starbuck , notwithstanding , was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery ; considering that i belonged to this uncommonly prudent starbuck \\' s boat ; and finally considering in what a devil \\' s chase i was implicated , touching the white whale : taking all things together , i say , i thought i might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will . \" queequeg ,\" said i , \" come along , you shall be my lawyer , executor , and legatee .\" it may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments , but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion . this was the fourth time in my nautical life that i had done the same thing . after the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion , i felt all the easier ; a stone was rolled away from my heart . besides , all the days i should now live would be as good as the days that lazarus lived after his resurrection ; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be . i survived myself ; my death and burial were locked up in my chest . i looked round me tranquilly and contentedly , like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault . now then , thought i , unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock , here goes for a cool , collected dive at death and destruction , and the devil fetch the hindmost . chapter 50 ahab \\' s boat and crew . fedallah . \" who would have thought it , flask !\" cried stubb ; \" if i had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat , unless maybe to stop the plug - hole with my timber toe . oh ! he \\' s a wonderful old man !\" \" i don \\' t think it so strange , after all , on that account ,\" said flask . \" if his leg were off at the hip , now , it would be a different thing . that would disable him ; but he has one knee , and good part of the other left , you know .\" \" i don \\' t know that , my little man ; i never yet saw him kneel .\" among whale - wise people it has often been argued whether , considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage , it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase . so tamerlane \\' s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes , whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight . but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect . considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger ; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties ; that every individual moment , indeed , then comprises a peril ; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale - boat in the hunt ? as a general thing , the joint - owners of the pequod must have plainly thought not . ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase , for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person , yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt -- above all for captain ahab to be supplied with five extra men , as that same boat \\' s crew , he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the pequod . therefore he had not solicited a boat \\' s crew from them , nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head . nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter . until cabaco \\' s published discovery , the sailors had little foreseen it , though to be sure when , after being a little while out of port , all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service ; when some time after this ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole - pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats , and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers , which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow : when all this was observed in him , and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat , as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb ; and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board , or clumsy cleat , as it is sometimes called , the horizontal piece in the boat \\' s bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale ; when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi - circular depression in the cleat , and with the carpenter \\' s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there ; all these things , i say , had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time . but almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of moby dick ; for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person . but such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat \\' s crew being assigned to that boat . now , with the subordinate phantoms , what wonder remained soon waned away ; for in a whaler wonders soon wane . besides , now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash - holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers ; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks , bits of wreck , oars , whaleboats , canoes , blown - off japanese junks , and what not ; that beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain , and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle . but be all this as it may , certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew , though still as it were somehow distinct from them , yet that hair - turbaned fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last . whence he came in a mannerly world like this , by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with ahab \\' s peculiar fortunes ; nay , so far as to have some sort of a half - hinted influence ; heaven knows , but it might have been even authority over him ; all this none knew . but one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning fedallah . he was such a creature as civilized , domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams , and that but dimly ; but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging asiatic communities , especially the oriental isles to the east of the continent -- those insulated , immemorial , unalterable countries , which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth \\' s primal generations , when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection , and all men his descendants , unknowing whence he came , eyed each other as real phantoms , and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end ; when though , according to genesis , the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men , the devils also , add the uncanonical rabbins , indulged in mundane amours . chapter 51 the spirit - spout . days , weeks passed , and under easy sail , the ivory pequod had slowly swept across four several cruising - grounds ; that off the azores ; off the cape de verdes ; on the plate ( so called ), being off the mouth of the rio de la plata ; and the carrol ground , an unstaked , watery locality , southerly from st . helena . it was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night , when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver ; and , by their soft , suffusing seethings , made what seemed a silvery silence , not a solitude ; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow . lit up by the moon , it looked celestial ; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea . fedallah first descried this jet . for of these moonlight nights , it was his wont to mount to the main - mast head , and stand a look - out there , with the same precision as if it had been day . and yet , though herds of whales were seen by night , not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them . you may think with what emotions , then , the seamen beheld this old oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours ; his turban and the moon , companions in one sky . but when , after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound ; when , after all this silence , his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery , moon - lit jet , every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging , and hailed the mortal crew . \" there she blows !\" had the trump of judgment blown , they could not have quivered more ; yet still they felt no terror ; rather pleasure . for though it was a most unwonted hour , yet so impressive was the cry , and so deliriously exciting , that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering . walking the deck with quick , side - lunging strides , ahab commanded the t \\' gallant sails and royals to be set , and every stunsail spread . the best man in the ship must take the helm . then , with every mast - head manned , the piled - up craft rolled down before the wind . the strange , upheaving , lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails , made the buoyant , hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet ; while still she rushed along , as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her -- one to mount direct to heaven , the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal . and had you watched ahab \\' s face that night , you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring . while his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck , every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin - tap . on life and death this old man walked . but though the ship so swiftly sped , and though from every eye , like arrows , the eager glances shot , yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night . every sailor swore he saw it once , but not a second time . this midnight - spout had almost grown a forgotten thing , when , some days after , lo ! at the same silent hour , it was again announced : again it was descried by all ; but upon making sail to overtake it , once more it disappeared as if it had never been . and so it served us night after night , till no one heeded it but to wonder at it . mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight , or starlight , as the case might be ; disappearing again for one whole day , or two days , or three ; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van , this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on . nor with the immemorial superstition of their race , and in accordance with the preternaturalness , as it seemed , which in many things invested the pequod , were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried ; at however remote times , or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes , that unnearable spout was cast by one self - same whale ; and that whale , moby dick . for a time , there reigned , too , a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition , as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on , in order that the monster might turn round upon us , and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas . these temporary apprehensions , so vague but so awful , derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather , in which , beneath all its blue blandness , some thought there lurked a devilish charm , as for days and days we voyaged along , through seas so wearily , lonesomely mild , that all space , in repugnance to our vengeful errand , seemed vacating itself of life before our urn - like prow . but , at last , when turning to the eastward , the cape winds began howling around us , and we rose and fell upon the long , troubled seas that are there ; when the ivory - tusked pequod sharply bowed to the blast , and gored the dark waves in her madness , till , like showers of silver chips , the foam - flakes flew over her bulwarks ; then all this desolate vacuity of life went away , but gave place to sights more dismal than before . close to our bows , strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us ; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea - ravens . and every morning , perched on our stays , rows of these birds were seen ; and spite of our hootings , for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp , as though they deemed our ship some drifting , uninhabited craft ; a thing appointed to desolation , and therefore fit roosting - place for their homeless selves . and heaved and heaved , still unrestingly heaved the black sea , as if its vast tides were a conscience ; and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred . cape of good hope , do they call ye ? rather cape tormentoto , as called of yore ; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us , we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea , where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish , seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store , or beat that black air without any horizon . but calm , snow - white , and unvarying ; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky ; still beckoning us on from before , the solitary jet would at times be descried . during all this blackness of the elements , ahab , though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck , manifested the gloomiest reserve ; and more seldom than ever addressed his mates . in tempestuous times like these , after everything above and aloft has been secured , nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale . then captain and crew become practical fatalists . so , with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole , and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud , ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward , while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together . meantime , the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows , stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist ; and the better to guard against the leaping waves , each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail , in which he swung as in a loosened belt . few or no words were spoken ; and the silent ship , as if manned by painted sailors in wax , day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves . by night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed ; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines ; still wordless ahab stood up to the blast . even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock . never could starbuck forget the old man \\' s aspect , when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood , he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor - screwed chair ; the rain and half - melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged , still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat . on the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of . his lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand . though the body was erect , the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell - tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling .* * the cabin - compass is called the tell - tale , because without going to the compass at the helm , the captain , while below , can inform himself of the course of the ship . terrible old man ! thought starbuck with a shudder , sleeping in this gale , still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose . chapter 52 the albatross . south - eastward from the cape , off the distant crozetts , a good cruising ground for right whalemen , a sail loomed ahead , the goney ( albatross ) by name . as she slowly drew nigh , from my lofty perch at the fore - mast - head , i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries -- a whaler at sea , and long absent from home . as if the waves had been fullers , this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus . all down her sides , this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust , while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoar - frost . only her lower sails were set . a wild sight it was to see her long - bearded look - outs at those three mast - heads . they seemed clad in the skins of beasts , so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising . standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast , they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea ; and though , when the ship slowly glided close under our stern , we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast - heads of one ship to those of the other ; yet , those forlorn - looking fishermen , mildly eyeing us as they passed , said not one word to our own look - outs , while the quarter - deck hail was being heard from below . \" ship ahoy ! have ye seen the white whale ?\" but as the strange captain , leaning over the pallid bulwarks , was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth , it somehow fell from his hand into the sea ; and the wind now rising amain , he in vain strove to make himself heard without it . meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between . while in various silent ways the seamen of the pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the white whale \\' s name to another ship , ahab for a moment paused ; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger , had not the threatening wind forbade . but taking advantage of his windward position , he again seized his trumpet , and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a nantucketer and shortly bound home , he loudly hailed --\" ahoy there ! this is the pequod , bound round the world ! tell them to address all future letters to the pacific ocean ! and this time three years , if i am not at home , tell them to address them to --\" at that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed , and instantly , then , in accordance with their singular ways , shoals of small harmless fish , that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side , darted away with what seemed shuddering fins , and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger \\' s flanks . though in the course of his continual voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight , yet , to any monomaniac man , the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings . \" swim away from me , do ye ?\" murmured ahab , gazing over into the water . there seemed but little in the words , but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced . but turning to the steersman , who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway , he cried out in his old lion voice ,--\" up helm ! keep her off round the world !\" round the world ! there is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings ; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct ? only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started , where those that we left behind secure , were all the time before us . were this world an endless plain , and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances , and discover sights more sweet and strange than any cyclades or islands of king solomon , then there were promise in the voyage . but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of , or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that , some time or other , swims before all human hearts ; while chasing such over this round globe , they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed . chapter 53 the gam . the ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this : the wind and sea betokened storms . but even had this not been the case , he would not after all , perhaps , have boarded her -- judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions -- if so it had been that , by the process of hailing , he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put . for , as it eventually turned out , he cared not to consort , even for five minutes , with any stranger captain , except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought . but all this might remain inadequately estimated , were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling - vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas , and especially on a common cruising - ground . if two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york state , or the equally desolate salisbury plain in england ; if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds , these twain , for the life of them , cannot well avoid a mutual salutation ; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news ; and , perhaps , sitting down for a while and resting in concert : then , how much more natural that upon the illimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea , two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth -- off lone fanning \\' s island , or the far away king \\' s mills ; how much more natural , i say , that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails , but come into still closer , more friendly and sociable contact . and especially would this seem to be a matter of course , in the case of vessels owned in one seaport , and whose captains , officers , and not a few of the men are personally known to each other ; and consequently , have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about . for the long absent ship , the outward - bounder , perhaps , has letters on board ; at any rate , she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb - worn files . and in return for that courtesy , the outward - bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising - ground to which she may be destined , a thing of the utmost importance to her . and in degree , all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other \\' s track on the cruising - ground itself , even though they are equally long absent from home . for one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third , and now far remote vessel ; and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets . besides , they would exchange the whaling news , and have an agreeable chat . for not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors , but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils . nor would difference of country make any very essential difference ; that is , so long as both parties speak one language , as is the case with americans and english . though , to be sure , from the small number of english whalers , such meetings do not very often occur , and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them ; for your englishman is rather reserved , and your yankee , he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself . besides , the english whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the american whalers ; regarding the long , lean nantucketer , with his nondescript provincialisms , as a sort of sea - peasant . but where this superiority in the english whalemen does really consist , it would be hard to say , seeing that the yankees in one day , collectively , kill more whales than all the english , collectively , in ten years . but this is a harmless little foible in the english whale - hunters , which the nantucketer does not take much to heart ; probably , because he knows that he has a few foibles himself . so , then , we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea , the whalers have most reason to be sociable -- and they are so . whereas , some merchant ships crossing each other \\' s wake in the mid - atlantic , will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition , mutually cutting each other on the high seas , like a brace of dandies in broadway ; and all the time indulging , perhaps , in finical criticism upon each other \\' s rig . as for men - of - war , when they chance to meet at sea , they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings , such a ducking of ensigns , that there does not seem to be much right - down hearty good - will and brotherly love about it at all . as touching slave - ships meeting , why , they are in such a prodigious hurry , they run away from each other as soon as possible . and as for pirates , when they chance to cross each other \\' s cross - bones , the first hail is --\" how many skulls ?\"-- the same way that whalers hail --\" how many barrels ?\" and that question once answered , pirates straightway steer apart , for they are infernal villains on both sides , and don \\' t like to see overmuch of each other \\' s villanous likenesses . but look at the godly , honest , unostentatious , hospitable , sociable , free - and - easy whaler ! what does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather ? she has a \" gam ,\" a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even ; and if by chance they should hear of it , they only grin at it , and repeat gamesome stuff about \" spouters \" and \" blubber - boilers ,\" and such like pretty exclamations . why it is that all merchant - seamen , and also all pirates and man - of - war \\' s men , and slave - ship sailors , cherish such a scornful feeling towards whale - ships ; this is a question it would be hard to answer . because , in the case of pirates , say , i should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it . it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation , indeed ; but only at the gallows . and besides , when a man is elevated in that odd fashion , he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude . hence , i conclude , that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman , in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on . but what is a gam ? you might wear out your index - finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries , and never find the word . dr . johnson never attained to that erudition ; noah webster \\' s ark does not hold it . nevertheless , this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankees . certainly , it needs a definition , and should be incorporated into the lexicon . with that view , let me learnedly define it . gam . noun -- a social meeting of two ( or more ) whaleships , generally on a cruising - ground ; when , after exchanging hails , they exchange visits by boats \\' crews ; the two captains remaining , for the time , on board of one ship , and the two chief mates on the other . there is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten here . all professions have their own little peculiarities of detail ; so has the whale fishery . in a pirate , man - of - war , or slave ship , when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat , he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable , sometimes cushioned seat there , and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner \\' s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons . but the whale - boat has no seat astern , no sofa of that sort whatever , and no tiller at all . high times indeed , if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs . and as for a tiller , the whale - boat never admits of any such effeminacy ; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat \\' s crew must leave the ship , and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number , that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion , and the captain , having no place to sit in , is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree . and often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships , this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs . nor is this any very easy matter ; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back , the after - oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front . he is thus completely wedged before and behind , and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs ; but a sudden , violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him , because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth . merely make a spread angle of two poles , and you cannot stand them up . then , again , it would never do in plain sight of the world \\' s riveted eyes , it would never do , i say , for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands ; indeed , as token of his entire , buoyant self - command , he generally carries his hands in his trowsers \\' pockets ; but perhaps being generally very large , heavy hands , he carries them there for ballast . nevertheless there have occurred instances , well authenticated ones too , where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two , in a sudden squall say -- to seize hold of the nearest oarsman \\' s hair , and hold on there like grim death . chapter 54 the town - ho \\' s story . ( as told at the golden inn ) the cape of good hope , and all the watery region round about there , is much like some noted four corners of a great highway , where you meet more travellers than in any other part . it was not very long after speaking the goney that another homeward - bound whaleman , the town - ho ,* was encountered . she was manned almost wholly by polynesians . in the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of moby dick . to some the general interest in the white whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the town - ho \\' s story , which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous , inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of god which at times are said to overtake some men . this latter circumstance , with its own particular accompaniments , forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated , never reached the ears of captain ahab or his mates . for that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the town - ho himself . it was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship , one of whom , it seems , communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions of secrecy , but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep , and revealed so much of it in that way , that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest . nevertheless , so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the pequod who came to the full knowledge of it , and by such a strange delicacy , to call it so , were they governed in this matter , that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the pequod \\' s main - mast . interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship , the whole of this strange affair i now proceed to put on lasting record . * the ancient whale - cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast - head , still used by whalemen in hunting the famous gallipagos terrapin . for my humor \\' s sake , i shall preserve the style in which i once narrated it at lima , to a lounging circle of my spanish friends , one saint \\' s eve , smoking upon the thick - gilt tiled piazza of the golden inn . of those fine cavaliers , the young dons , pedro and sebastian , were on the closer terms with me ; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put , and which are duly answered at the time . \" some two years prior to my first learning the events which i am about rehearsing to you , gentlemen , the town - ho , sperm whaler of nantucket , was cruising in your pacific here , not very many days \\' sail eastward from the eaves of this good golden inn . she was somewhere to the northward of the line . one morning upon handling the pumps , according to daily usage , it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common . they supposed a sword - fish had stabbed her , gentlemen . but the captain , having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes ; and therefore being very averse to quit them , and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous , though , indeed , they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather , the ship still continued her cruisings , the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals ; but no good luck came ; more days went by , and not only was the leak yet undiscovered , but it sensibly increased . so much so , that now taking some alarm , the captain , making all sail , stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands , there to have his hull hove out and repaired . \" though no small passage was before her , yet , if the commonest chance favoured , he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way , because his pumps were of the best , and being periodically relieved at them , those six - and - thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free ; never mind if the leak should double on her . in truth , well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes , the town - ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality , had it not been for the brutal overbearing of radney , the mate , a vineyarder , and the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt , a lakeman and desperado from buffalo . \"\\' lakeman !-- buffalo ! pray , what is a lakeman , and where is buffalo ?\\' said don sebastian , rising in his swinging mat of grass . \" on the eastern shore of our lake erie , don ; but -- i crave your courtesy -- may be , you shall soon hear further of all that . now , gentlemen , in square - sail brigs and three - masted ships , well - nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far manilla ; this lakeman , in the land - locked heart of our america , had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean . for in their interflowing aggregate , those grand fresh - water seas of ours ,-- erie , and ontario , and huron , and superior , and michigan ,-- possess an ocean - like expansiveness , with many of the ocean \\' s noblest traits ; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes . they contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles , even as the polynesian waters do ; in large part , are shored by two great contrasting nations , as the atlantic is ; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east , dotted all round their banks ; here and there are frowned upon by batteries , and by the goat - like craggy guns of lofty mackinaw ; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories ; at intervals , they yield their beaches to wild barbarians , whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams ; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests , where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in gothic genealogies ; those same woods harboring wild afric beasts of prey , and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to tartar emperors ; they mirror the paved capitals of buffalo and cleveland , as well as winnebago villages ; they float alike the full - rigged merchant ship , the armed cruiser of the state , the steamer , and the beech canoe ; they are swept by borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave ; they know what shipwrecks are , for out of sight of land , however inland , they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew . thus , gentlemen , though an inlander , steelkilt was wild - ocean born , and wild - ocean nurtured ; as much of an audacious mariner as any . and for radney , though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket beach , to nurse at his maternal sea ; though in after life he had long followed our austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific ; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman , fresh from the latitudes of buck - horn handled bowie - knives . yet was this nantucketer a man with some good - hearted traits ; and this lakeman , a mariner , who though a sort of devil indeed , might yet by inflexible firmness , only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave \\' s right ; thus treated , this steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile . at all events , he had proved so thus far ; but radney was doomed and made mad , and steelkilt -- but , gentlemen , you shall hear . \" it was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven , that the town - ho \\' s leak seemed again increasing , but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day . you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our atlantic , for example , some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it ; though of a still , sleepy night , should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect , the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it , on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom . nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward , gentlemen , is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump - handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length ; that is , if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast , or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them . it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters , some really landless latitude , that her captain begins to feel a little anxious . \" much this way had it been with the town - ho ; so when her leak was found gaining once more , there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company ; especially by radney the mate . he commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted , sheeted home anew , and every way expanded to the breeze . now this radney , i suppose , was as little of a coward , and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless , unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine , gentlemen . therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship , some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her . so when they were working that evening at the pumps , there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them , as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water ; clear as any mountain spring , gentlemen -- that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck , and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper - holes . \" now , as you well know , it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours -- watery or otherwise ; that when a person placed in command over his fellow - men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood , straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness ; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern \\' s tower , and make a little heap of dust of it . be this conceit of mine as it may , gentlemen , at all events steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a roman , and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy \\' s snorting charger ; and a brain , and a heart , and a soul in him , gentlemen , which had made steelkilt charlemagne , had he been born son to charlemagne \\' s father . but radney , the mate , was ugly as a mule ; yet as hardy , as stubborn , as malicious . he did not love steelkilt , and steelkilt knew it . \" espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest , the lakeman affected not to notice him , but unawed , went on with his gay banterings . \"\\' aye , aye , my merry lads , it \\' s a lively leak this ; hold a cannikin , one of ye , and let \\' s have a taste . by the lord , it \\' s worth bottling ! i tell ye what , men , old rad \\' s investment must go for it ! he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home . the fact is , boys , that sword - fish only began the job ; he \\' s come back again with a gang of ship - carpenters , saw - fish , and file - fish , and what not ; and the whole posse of \\' em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom ; making improvements , i suppose . if old rad were here now , i \\' d tell him to jump overboard and scatter \\' em . they \\' re playing the devil with his estate , i can tell him . but he \\' s a simple old soul ,-- rad , and a beauty too . boys , they say the rest of his property is invested in looking - glasses . i wonder if he \\' d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose .\\' \"\\' damn your eyes ! what \\' s that pump stopping for ?\\' roared radney , pretending not to have heard the sailors \\' talk . \\' thunder away at it !\\' \\' aye , aye , sir ,\\' said steelkilt , merry as a cricket . \\' lively , boys , lively , now !\\' and with that the pump clanged like fifty fire - engines ; the men tossed their hats off to it , and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life \\' s utmost energies . \" quitting the pump at last , with the rest of his band , the lakeman went forward all panting , and sat himself down on the windlass ; his face fiery red , his eyes bloodshot , and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow . now what cozening fiend it was , gentlemen , that possessed radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state , i know not ; but so it happened . intolerably striding along the deck , the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks , and also a shovel , and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large . \" now , gentlemen , sweeping a ship \\' s deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening ; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time . such , gentlemen , is the inflexibility of sea - usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen ; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces . but in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys , if boys there be aboard . besides , it was the stronger men in the town - ho that had been divided into gangs , taking turns at the pumps ; and being the most athletic seaman of them all , steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs ; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties , such being the case with his comrades . i mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men . \" but there was more than this : the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt , as though radney had spat in his face . any man who has gone sailor in a whale - ship will understand this ; and all this and doubtless much more , the lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command . but as he sat still for a moment , and as he steadfastly looked into the mate \\' s malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder - casks heaped up in him and the slow - match silently burning along towards them ; as he instinctively saw all this , that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being -- a repugnance most felt , when felt at all , by really valiant men even when aggrieved -- this nameless phantom feeling , gentlemen , stole over steelkilt . \" therefore , in his ordinary tone , only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in , he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business , and he would not do it . and then , without at all alluding to the shovel , he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers ; who , not being billeted at the pumps , had done little or nothing all day . to this , radney replied with an oath , in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command ; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman , with an uplifted cooper \\' s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by . \" heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps , for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate ; but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him , without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat , till at last the incensed radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face , furiously commanding him to do his bidding . \" steelkilt rose , and slowly retreating round the windlass , steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer , deliberately repeated his intention not to obey . seeing , however , that his forbearance had not the slightest effect , by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man ; but it was to no purpose . and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass ; when , resolved at last no longer to retreat , bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor , the lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer : \"\\' mr . radney , i will not obey you . take that hammer away , or look to yourself .\\' but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him , where the lakeman stood fixed , now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth ; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions . retreating not the thousandth part of an inch ; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance , steelkilt , clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back , told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he ( steelkilt ) would murder him . but , gentlemen , the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods . immediately the hammer touched the cheek ; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head ; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale . \" ere the cry could go aft steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads . they were both canallers . \"\\' canallers !\\' cried don pedro . \\' we have seen many whale - ships in our harbours , but never heard of your canallers . pardon : who and what are they ?\\' \"\\' canallers , don , are the boatmen belonging to our grand erie canal . you must have heard of it .\\' \"\\' nay , senor ; hereabouts in this dull , warm , most lazy , and hereditary land , we know but little of your vigorous north .\\' \"\\' aye ? well then , don , refill my cup . your chicha \\' s very fine ; and ere proceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are ; for such information may throw side - light upon my story .\\' \" for three hundred and sixty miles , gentlemen , through the entire breadth of the state of new york ; through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages ; through long , dismal , uninhabited swamps , and affluent , cultivated fields , unrivalled for fertility ; by billiard - room and bar - room ; through the holy - of - holies of great forests ; on roman arches over indian rivers ; through sun and shade ; by happy hearts or broken ; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk counties ; and especially , by rows of snow - white chapels , whose spires stand almost like milestones , flows one continual stream of venetianly corrupt and often lawless life . there \\' s your true ashantee , gentlemen ; there howl your pagans ; where you ever find them , next door to you ; under the long - flung shadow , and the snug patronising lee of churches . for by some curious fatality , as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice , so sinners , gentlemen , most abound in holiest vicinities . \"\\' is that a friar passing ?\\' said don pedro , looking downwards into the crowded plazza , with humorous concern . \"\\' well for our northern friend , dame isabella \\' s inquisition wanes in lima ,\\' laughed don sebastian . \\' proceed , senor .\\' \"\\' a moment ! pardon !\\' cried another of the company . \\' in the name of all us limeese , i but desire to express to you , sir sailor , that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present lima for distant venice in your corrupt comparison . oh ! do not bow and look surprised ; you know the proverb all along this coast --\" corrupt as lima .\" it but bears out your saying , too ; churches more plentiful than billiard - tables , and for ever open -- and \" corrupt as lima .\" so , too , venice ; i have been there ; the holy city of the blessed evangelist , st . mark !-- st . dominic , purge it ! your cup ! thanks : here i refill ; now , you pour out again .\\' \" freely depicted in his own vocation , gentlemen , the canaller would make a fine dramatic hero , so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he . like mark antony , for days and days along his green - turfed , flowery nile , he indolently floats , openly toying with his red - cheeked cleopatra , ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck . but ashore , all this effeminacy is dashed . the brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly sports ; his slouched and gaily - ribboned hat betoken his grand features . a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats ; his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities . once a vagabond on his own canal , i have received good turns from one of these canallers ; i thank him heartily ; would fain be not ungrateful ; but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence , that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait , as to plunder a wealthy one . in sum , gentlemen , what the wildness of this canal life is , is emphatically evinced by this ; that our wild whale - fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates , and that scarce any race of mankind , except sydney men , are so much distrusted by our whaling captains . nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter , that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line , the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a christian corn - field , and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas . \"\\' i see ! i see !\\' impetuously exclaimed don pedro , spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles . \\' no need to travel ! the world \\' s one lima . i had thought , now , that at your temperate north the generations were cold and holy as the hills .-- but the story .\\' \" i left off , gentlemen , where the lakeman shook the backstay . hardly had he done so , when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers , who all crowded him to the deck . but sliding down the ropes like baleful comets , the two canallers rushed into the uproar , and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle . others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt , and a twisted turmoil ensued ; while standing out of harm \\' s way , the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale - pike , calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel , and smoke him along to the quarter - deck . at intervals , he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion , and prying into the heart of it with his pike , sought to prick out the object of his resentment . but steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all ; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck , where , hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass , these sea - parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade . \"\\' come out of that , ye pirates !\\' roared the captain , now menacing them with a pistol in each hand , just brought to him by the steward . \\' come out of that , ye cut - throats !\\' \" steelkilt leaped on the barricade , and striding up and down there , defied the worst the pistols could do ; but gave the captain to understand distinctly , that his ( steelkilt \\' s ) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands . fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true , the captain a little desisted , but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty . \"\\' will you promise not to touch us , if we do ?\\' demanded their ringleader . \"\\' turn to ! turn to !-- i make no promise ;-- to your duty ! do you want to sink the ship , by knocking off at a time like this ? turn to !\\' and he once more raised a pistol . \"\\' sink the ship ?\\' cried steelkilt . \\' aye , let her sink . not a man of us turns to , unless you swear not to raise a rope - yarn against us . what say ye , men ?\\' turning to his comrades . a fierce cheer was their response . \" the lakeman now patrolled the barricade , all the while keeping his eye on the captain , and jerking out such sentences as these :--\\' it \\' s not our fault ; we didn \\' t want it ; i told him to take his hammer away ; it was boy \\' s business ; he might have known me before this ; i told him not to prick the buffalo ; i believe i have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw ; ain \\' t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there , men ? look to those handspikes , my hearties . captain , by god , look to yourself ; say the word ; don \\' t be a fool ; forget it all ; we are ready to turn to ; treat us decently , and we \\' re your men ; but we won \\' t be flogged .\\' \"\\' turn to ! i make no promises , turn to , i say !\\' \"\\' look ye , now ,\\' cried the lakeman , flinging out his arm towards him , \\' there are a few of us here ( and i am one of them ) who have shipped for the cruise , d \\' ye see ; now as you well know , sir , we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down ; so we don \\' t want a row ; it \\' s not our interest ; we want to be peaceable ; we are ready to work , but we won \\' t be flogged .\\' \"\\' turn to !\\' roared the captain . \" steelkilt glanced round him a moment , and then said :--\\' i tell you what it is now , captain , rather than kill ye , and be hung for such a shabby rascal , we won \\' t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us ; but till you say the word about not flogging us , we don \\' t do a hand \\' s turn .\\' \"\\' down into the forecastle then , down with ye , i \\' ll keep ye there till ye \\' re sick of it . down ye go .\\' \"\\' shall we ?\\' cried the ringleader to his men . most of them were against it ; but at length , in obedience to steelkilt , they preceded him down into their dark den , growlingly disappearing , like bears into a cave . \" as the lakeman \\' s bare head was just level with the planks , the captain and his posse leaped the barricade , and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle , planted their group of hands upon it , and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway . then opening the slide a little , the captain whispered something down the crack , closed it , and turned the key upon them -- ten in number -- leaving on deck some twenty or more , who thus far had remained neutral . \" all night a wide - awake watch was kept by all the officers , forward and aft , especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway ; at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge , after breaking through the bulkhead below . but the hours of darkness passed in peace ; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps , whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship . \" at sunrise the captain went forward , and knocking on the deck , summoned the prisoners to work ; but with a yell they refused . water was then lowered down to them , and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it ; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it , the captain returned to the quarter - deck . twice every day for three days this was repeated ; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling , and then a scuffling was heard , as the customary summons was delivered ; and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle , saying they were ready to turn to . the fetid closeness of the air , and a famishing diet , united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution , had constrained them to surrender at discretion . emboldened by this , the captain reiterated his demand to the rest , but steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged . on the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them . only three were left . \"\\' better turn to , now ?\\' said the captain with a heartless jeer . \"\\' shut us up again , will ye !\\' cried steelkilt . \"\\' oh certainly ,\\' the captain , and the key clicked . \" it was at this point , gentlemen , that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates , and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him , and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair ; it was then that steelkilt proposed to the two canallers , thus far apparently of one mind with him , to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison ; and armed with their keen mincing knives ( long , crescentic , heavy implements with a handle at each end ) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail ; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible , seize the ship . for himself , he would do this , he said , whether they joined him or not . that was the last night he should spend in that den . but the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two ; they swore they were ready for that , or for any other mad thing , for anything in short but a surrender . and what was more , they each insisted upon being the first man on deck , when the time to make the rush should come . but to this their leader as fiercely objected , reserving that priority for himself ; particularly as his two comrades would not yield , the one to the other , in the matter ; and both of them could not be first , for the ladder would but admit one man at a time . and here , gentlemen , the foul play of these miscreants must come out . \" upon hearing the frantic project of their leader , each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted , it would seem , upon the same piece of treachery , namely : to be foremost in breaking out , in order to be the first of the three , though the last of the ten , to surrender ; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit . but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last , they in some way , by some subtle chemistry of villany , mixed their before secret treacheries together ; and when their leader fell into a doze , verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences ; and bound the sleeper with cords , and gagged him with cords ; and shrieked out for the captain at midnight . \" thinking murder at hand , and smelling in the dark for the blood , he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle . in a few minutes the scuttle was opened , and , bound hand and foot , the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies , who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder . but all these were collared , and dragged along the deck like dead cattle ; and , side by side , were seized up into the mizzen rigging , like three quarters of meat , and there they hung till morning . \\' damn ye ,\\' cried the captain , pacing to and fro before them , \\' the vultures would not touch ye , ye villains !\\' \" at sunrise he summoned all hands ; and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny , he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round -- thought , upon the whole , he would do so -- he ought to -- justice demanded it ; but for the present , considering their timely surrender , he would let them go with a reprimand , which he accordingly administered in the vernacular . \"\\' but as for you , ye carrion rogues ,\\' turning to the three men in the rigging --\\' for you , i mean to mince ye up for the try - pots ;\\' and , seizing a rope , he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors , till they yelled no more , but lifelessly hung their heads sideways , as the two crucified thieves are drawn . \"\\' my wrist is sprained with ye !\\' he cried , at last ; \\' but there is still rope enough left for you , my fine bantam , that wouldn \\' t give up . take that gag from his mouth , and let us hear what he can say for himself .\\' \" for a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws , and then painfully twisting round his head , said in a sort of hiss , \\' what i say is this -- and mind it well -- if you flog me , i murder you !\\' \"\\' say ye so ? then see how ye frighten me \\'-- and the captain drew off with the rope to strike . \"\\' best not ,\\' hissed the lakeman . \"\\' but i must ,\\'-- and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke . \" steelkilt here hissed out something , inaudible to all but the captain ; who , to the amazement of all hands , started back , paced the deck rapidly two or three times , and then suddenly throwing down his rope , said , \\' i won \\' t do it -- let him go -- cut him down : d \\' ye hear ?\\' but as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order , a pale man , with a bandaged head , arrested them -- radney the chief mate . ever since the blow , he had lain in his berth ; but that morning , hearing the tumult on the deck , he had crept out , and thus far had watched the whole scene . such was the state of his mouth , that he could hardly speak ; but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt , he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe . \"\\' you are a coward !\\' hissed the lakeman . \"\\' so i am , but take that .\\' the mate was in the very act of striking , when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm . he paused : and then pausing no more , made good his word , spite of steelkilt \\' s threat , whatever that might have been . the three men were then cut down , all hands were turned to , and , sullenly worked by the moody seamen , the iron pumps clanged as before . \" just after dark that day , when one watch had retired below , a clamor was heard in the forecastle ; and the two trembling traitors running up , besieged the cabin door , saying they durst not consort with the crew . entreaties , cuffs , and kicks could not drive them back , so at their own instance they were put down in the ship \\' s run for salvation . still , no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest . on the contrary , it seemed , that mainly at steelkilt \\' s instigation , they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness , obey all orders to the last , and , when the ship reached port , desert her in a body . but in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage , they all agreed to another thing -- namely , not to sing out for whales , in case any should be discovered . for , spite of her leak , and spite of all her other perils , the town - ho still maintained her mast - heads , and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment , as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground ; and radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat , and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale . \" but though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct , he kept his own counsel ( at least till all was over ) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart . he was in radney the chief mate \\' s watch ; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom , after the scene at the rigging , he insisted , against the express counsel of the captain , upon resuming the head of his watch at night . upon this , and one or two other circumstances , steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge . \" during the night , radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter - deck , and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there , a little above the ship \\' s side . in this attitude , it was well known , he sometimes dozed . there was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship , and down between this was the sea . steelkilt calculated his time , and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o \\' clock , in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed . at his leisure , he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below . \"\\' what are you making there ?\\' said a shipmate . \"\\' what do you think ? what does it look like ?\\' \"\\' like a lanyard for your bag ; but it \\' s an odd one , seems to me .\\' \\' yes , rather oddish ,\\' said the lakeman , holding it at arm \\' s length before him ; \\' but i think it will answer . shipmate , i haven \\' t enough twine ,-- have you any ?\\' \" but there was none in the forecastle . \"\\' then i must get some from old rad ;\\' and he rose to go aft . \"\\' you don \\' t mean to go a begging to him !\\' said a sailor . \"\\' why not ? do you think he won \\' t do me a turn , when it \\' s to help himself in the end , shipmate ?\\' and going to the mate , he looked at him quietly , and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock . it was given him -- neither twine nor lanyard were seen again ; but the next night an iron ball , closely netted , partly rolled from the pocket of the lakeman \\' s monkey jacket , as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow . twenty - four hours after , his trick at the silent helm -- nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman \\' s hand -- that fatal hour was then to come ; and in the fore - ordaining soul of steelkilt , the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse , with his forehead crushed in . \" but , gentlemen , a fool saved the would - be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned . yet complete revenge he had , and without being the avenger . for by a mysterious fatality , heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done . \" it was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day , when they were washing down the decks , that a stupid teneriffe man , drawing water in the main - chains , all at once shouted out , \\' there she rolls ! there she rolls !\\' jesu , what a whale ! it was moby dick . \"\\' moby dick !\\' cried don sebastian ; \\' st . dominic ! sir sailor , but do whales have christenings ? whom call you moby dick ?\\' \"\\' a very white , and famous , and most deadly immortal monster , don ;-- but that would be too long a story .\\' \"\\' how ? how ?\\' cried all the young spaniards , crowding . \"\\' nay , dons , dons -- nay , nay ! i cannot rehearse that now . let me get more into the air , sirs .\\' \"\\' the chicha ! the chicha !\\' cried don pedro ; \\' our vigorous friend looks faint ;-- fill up his empty glass !\\' \" no need , gentlemen ; one moment , and i proceed .-- now , gentlemen , so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship -- forgetful of the compact among the crew -- in the excitement of the moment , the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster , though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast - heads . all was now a phrensy . \\' the white whale -- the white whale !\\' was the cry from captain , mates , and harpooneers , who , undeterred by fearful rumours , were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish ; while the dogged crew eyed askance , and with curses , the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass , that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun , shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea . gentlemen , a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events , as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted . the mutineer was the bowsman of the mate , and when fast to a fish , it was his duty to sit next him , while radney stood up with his lance in the prow , and haul in or slacken the line , at the word of command . moreover , when the four boats were lowered , the mate \\' s got the start ; and none howled more fiercely with delight than did steelkilt , as he strained at his oar . after a stiff pull , their harpooneer got fast , and , spear in hand , radney sprang to the bow . he was always a furious man , it seems , in a boat . and now his bandaged cry was , to beach him on the whale \\' s topmost back . nothing loath , his bowsman hauled him up and up , through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together ; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge , and keeling over , spilled out the standing mate . that instant , as he fell on the whale \\' s slippery back , the boat righted , and was dashed aside by the swell , while radney was tossed over into the sea , on the other flank of the whale . he struck out through the spray , and , for an instant , was dimly seen through that veil , wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of moby dick . but the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom ; seized the swimmer between his jaws ; and rearing high up with him , plunged headlong again , and went down . \" meantime , at the first tap of the boat \\' s bottom , the lakeman had slackened the line , so as to drop astern from the whirlpool ; calmly looking on , he thought his own thoughts . but a sudden , terrific , downward jerking of the boat , quickly brought his knife to the line . he cut it ; and the whale was free . but , at some distance , moby dick rose again , with some tatters of radney \\' s red woollen shirt , caught in the teeth that had destroyed him . all four boats gave chase again ; but the whale eluded them , and finally wholly disappeared . \" in good time , the town - ho reached her port -- a savage , solitary place -- where no civilized creature resided . there , headed by the lakeman , all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms ; eventually , as it turned out , seizing a large double war - canoe of the savages , and setting sail for some other harbor . \" the ship \\' s company being reduced to but a handful , the captain called upon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak . but to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated , both by night and by day , and so extreme was the hard work they underwent , that upon the vessel being ready again for sea , they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel . after taking counsel with his officers , he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible ; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows ; stacked his muskets on the poop ; and warning the islanders not to approach the ship at their peril , took one man with him , and setting the sail of his best whale - boat , steered straight before the wind for tahiti , five hundred miles distant , to procure a reinforcement to his crew . \" on the fourth day of the sail , a large canoe was descried , which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals . he steered away from it ; but the savage craft bore down on him ; and soon the voice of steelkilt hailed him to heave to , or he would run him under water . the captain presented a pistol . with one foot on each prow of the yoked war - canoes , the lakeman laughed him to scorn ; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock , he would bury him in bubbles and foam . \"\\' what do you want of me ?\\' cried the captain . \"\\' where are you bound ? and for what are you bound ?\\' demanded steelkilt ; \\' no lies .\\' \"\\' i am bound to tahiti for more men .\\' \"\\' very good . let me board you a moment -- i come in peace .\\' with that he leaped from the canoe , swam to the boat ; and climbing the gunwale , stood face to face with the captain . \"\\' cross your arms , sir ; throw back your head . now , repeat after me . as soon as steelkilt leaves me , i swear to beach this boat on yonder island , and remain there six days . if i do not , may lightning strike me !\\' \"\\' a pretty scholar ,\\' laughed the lakeman . \\' adios , senor !\\' and leaping into the sea , he swam back to his comrades . \" watching the boat till it was fairly beached , and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa - nut trees , steelkilt made sail again , and in due time arrived at tahiti , his own place of destination . there , luck befriended him ; two ships were about to sail for france , and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed . they embarked ; and so for ever got the start of their former captain , had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution . \" some ten days after the french ships sailed , the whale - boat arrived , and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized tahitians , who had been somewhat used to the sea . chartering a small native schooner , he returned with them to his vessel ; and finding all right there , again resumed his cruisings . \" where steelkilt now is , gentlemen , none know ; but upon the island of nantucket , the widow of radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead ; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him . \"\\' are you through ?\\' said don sebastian , quietly . \"\\' i am , don .\\' \"\\' then i entreat you , tell me if to the best of your own convictions , this your story is in substance really true ? it is so passing wonderful ! did you get it from an unquestionable source ? bear with me if i seem to press .\\' \"\\' also bear with all of us , sir sailor ; for we all join in don sebastian \\' s suit ,\\' cried the company , with exceeding interest . \"\\' is there a copy of the holy evangelists in the golden inn , gentlemen ?\\' \"\\' nay ,\\' said don sebastian ; \\' but i know a worthy priest near by , who will quickly procure one for me . i go for it ; but are you well advised ? this may grow too serious .\\' \"\\' will you be so good as to bring the priest also , don ?\\' \"\\' though there are no auto - da - fe \\' s in lima now ,\\' said one of the company to another ; \\' i fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy . let us withdraw more out of the moonlight . i see no need of this .\\' \"\\' excuse me for running after you , don sebastian ; but may i also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized evangelists you can .\\' \\' this is the priest , he brings you the evangelists ,\\' said don sebastian , gravely , returning with a tall and solemn figure . \"\\' let me remove my hat . now , venerable priest , further into the light , and hold the holy book before me that i may touch it . \"\\' so help me heaven , and on my honour the story i have told ye , gentlemen , is in substance and its great items , true . i know it to be true ; it happened on this ball ; i trod the ship ; i knew the crew ; i have seen and talked with steelkilt since the death of radney .\\'\" chapter 55 of the monstrous pictures of whales . i shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas , something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whale - ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there . it may be worth while , therefore , previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman . it is time to set the world right in this matter , by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong . it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest hindoo , egyptian , and grecian sculptures . for ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples , the pedestals of statues , and on shields , medallions , cups , and coins , the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain - armor like saladin \\' s , and a helmeted head like st . george \\' s ; ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed , not only in most popular pictures of the whale , but in many scientific presentations of him . now , by all odds , the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale \\' s , is to be found in the famous cavern - pagoda of elephanta , in india . the brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda , all the trades and pursuits , every conceivable avocation of man , were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being . no wonder then , that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth . the hindoo whale referred to , occurs in a separate department of the wall , depicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan , learnedly known as the matse avatar . but though this sculpture is half man and half whale , so as only to give the tail of the latter , yet that small section of him is all wrong . it looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda , than the broad palms of the true whale \\' s majestic flukes . but go to the old galleries , and look now at a great christian painter \\' s portrait of this fish ; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian hindoo . it is guido \\' s picture of perseus rescuing andromeda from the sea - monster or whale . where did guido get the model of such a strange creature as that ? nor does hogarth , in painting the same scene in his own \" perseus descending ,\" make out one whit better . the huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on the surface , scarcely drawing one inch of water . it has a sort of howdah on its back , and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling , might be taken for the traitors \\' gate leading from the thames by water into the tower . then , there are the prodromus whales of old scotch sibbald , and jonah \\' s whale , as depicted in the prints of old bibles and the cuts of old primers . what shall be said of these ? as for the book - binder \\' s whale winding like a vine - stalk round the stock of a descending anchor -- as stamped and gilded on the backs and title - pages of many books both old and new -- that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature , imitated , i take it , from the like figures on antique vases . though universally denominated a dolphin , i nevertheless call this book - binder \\' s fish an attempt at a whale ; because it was so intended when the device was first introduced . it was introduced by an old italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century , during the revival of learning ; and in those days , and even down to a comparatively late period , dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the leviathan . in the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale , where all manner of spouts , jets d \\' eau , hot springs and cold , saratoga and baden - baden , come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain . in the title - page of the original edition of the \" advancement of learning \" you will find some curious whales . but quitting all these unprofessional attempts , let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober , scientific delineations , by those who know . in old harris \\' s collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages , a . d . 1671 , entitled \" a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the whale , peter peterson of friesland , master .\" in one of those plates the whales , like great rafts of logs , are represented lying among ice - isles , with white bears running over their living backs . in another plate , the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes . then again , there is an imposing quarto , written by one captain colnett , a post captain in the english navy , entitled \" a voyage round cape horn into the south seas , for the purpose of extending the spermaceti whale fisheries .\" in this book is an outline purporting to be a \" picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale , drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of mexico , august , 1793 , and hoisted on deck .\" i doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines . to mention but one thing about it , let me say that it has an eye which applied , according to the accompanying scale , to a full grown sperm whale , would make the eye of that whale a bow - window some five feet long . ah , my gallant captain , why did ye not give us jonah looking out of that eye ! nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for the benefit of the young and tender , free from the same heinousness of mistake . look at that popular work \" goldsmith \\' s animated nature .\" in the abridged london edition of 1807 , there are plates of an alleged \" whale \" and a \" narwhale .\" i do not wish to seem inelegant , but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow ; and , as for the narwhale , one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one , that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys . then , again , in 1825 , bernard germain , count de lacepede , a great naturalist , published a scientific systemized whale book , wherein are several pictures of the different species of the leviathan . all these are not only incorrect , but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland whale ( that is to say , the right whale ), even scoresby , a long experienced man as touching that species , declares not to have its counterpart in nature . but the placing of the cap - sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific frederick cuvier , brother to the famous baron . in 1836 , he published a natural history of whales , in which he gives what he calls a picture of the sperm whale . before showing that picture to any nantucketer , you had best provide for your summary retreat from nantucket . in a word , frederick cuvier \\' s sperm whale is not a sperm whale , but a squash . of course , he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage ( such men seldom have ), but whence he derived that picture , who can tell ? perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field , desmarest , got one of his authentic abortions ; that is , from a chinese drawing . and what sort of lively lads with the pencil those chinese are , many queer cups and saucers inform us . as for the sign - painters \\' whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil - dealers , what shall be said of them ? they are generally richard iii . whales , with dromedary humps , and very savage ; breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts , that is whaleboats full of mariners : their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint . but these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all . consider ! most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish ; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship , with broken back , would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars . though elephants have stood for their full - lengths , the living leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait . the living whale , in his full majesty and significance , is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters ; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight , like a launched line - of - battle ship ; and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air , so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations . and , not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full - grown platonian leviathan ; yet , even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship \\' s deck , such is then the outlandish , eel - like , limbered , varying shape of him , that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch . but it may be fancied , that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale , accurate hints may be derived touching his true form . not at all . for it is one of the more curious things about this leviathan , that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape . though jeremy bentham \\' s skeleton , which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors , correctly conveys the idea of a burly - browed utilitarian old gentleman , with all jeremy \\' s other leading personal characteristics ; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan \\' s articulated bones . in fact , as the great hunter says , the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it . this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head , as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown . it is also very curiously displayed in the side fin , the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand , minus only the thumb . this fin has four regular bone - fingers , the index , middle , ring , and little finger . but all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering , as the human fingers in an artificial covering . \" however recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us ,\" said humorous stubb one day , \" he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens .\" for all these reasons , then , any way you may look at it , you must needs conclude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last . true , one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another , but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness . so there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like . and the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour , is by going a whaling yourself ; but by so doing , you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him . wherefore , it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan . chapter 56 of the less erroneous pictures of whales , and the true pictures of whaling scenes . in connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales , i am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books , both ancient and modern , especially in pliny , purchas , hackluyt , harris , cuvier , etc . but i pass that matter by . i know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale ; colnett \\' s , huggins \\' s , frederick cuvier \\' s , and beale \\' s . in the previous chapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to . huggins \\' s is far better than theirs ; but , by great odds , beale \\' s is the best . all beale \\' s drawings of this whale are good , excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes , capping his second chapter . his frontispiece , boats attacking sperm whales , though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men , is admirably correct and life - like in its general effect . some of the sperm whale drawings in j . ross browne are pretty correct in contour ; but they are wretchedly engraved . that is not his fault though . of the right whale , the best outline pictures are in scoresby ; but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression . he has but one picture of whaling scenes , and this is a sad deficiency , because it is by such pictures only , when at all well done , that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters . but , taken for all in all , by far the finest , though in some details not the most correct , presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found , are two large french engravings , well executed , and taken from paintings by one garnery . respectively , they represent attacks on the sperm and right whale . in the first engraving a noble sperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might , just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean , and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks . the prow of the boat is partially unbroken , and is drawn just balancing upon the monster \\' s spine ; and standing in that prow , for that one single incomputable flash of time , you behold an oarsman , half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale , and in the act of leaping , as if from a precipice . the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true . the half - emptied line - tub floats on the whitened sea ; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it ; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright ; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene . serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale , but let that pass ; since , for the life of me , i could not draw so good a one . in the second engraving , the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running right whale , that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock - slide from the patagonian cliffs . his jets are erect , full , and black like soot ; so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney , you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below . sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs , shell - fish , and other sea candies and maccaroni , which the right whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back . and all the while the thick - lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep , leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake , and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle - wheels of an ocean steamer . thus , the foreground is all raging commotion ; but behind , in admirable artistic contrast , is the glassy level of a sea becalmed , the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship , and the inert mass of a dead whale , a conquered fortress , with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale - pole inserted into his spout - hole . who garnery the painter is , or was , i know not . but my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject , or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman . the french are the lads for painting action . go and gaze upon all the paintings of europe , and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas , as in that triumphal hall at versailles ; where the beholder fights his way , pell - mell , through the consecutive great battles of france ; where every sword seems a flash of the northern lights , and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by , like a charge of crowned centaurs ? not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery , are these sea battle - pieces of garnery . the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes . with not one tenth of england \\' s experience in the fishery , and not the thousandth part of that of the americans , they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt . for the most part , the english and american whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things , such as the vacant profile of the whale ; which , so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned , is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid . even scoresby , the justly renowned right whaleman , after giving us a stiff full length of the greenland whale , and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises , treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks , chopping knives , and grapnels ; and with the microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety - six fac - similes of magnified arctic snow crystals . i mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager ( i honour him for a veteran ), but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a greenland justice of the peace . in addition to those fine engravings from garnery , there are two other french engravings worthy of note , by some one who subscribes himself \" h . durand .\" one of them , though not precisely adapted to our present purpose , nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts . it is a quiet noon - scene among the isles of the pacific ; a french whaler anchored , inshore , in a calm , and lazily taking water on board ; the loosened sails of the ship , and the long leaves of the palms in the background , both drooping together in the breezeless air . the effect is very fine , when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose . the other engraving is quite a different affair : the ship hove - to upon the open sea , and in the very heart of the leviathanic life , with a right whale alongside ; the vessel ( in the act of cutting - in ) hove over to the monster as if to a quay ; and a boat , hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity , is about giving chase to whales in the distance . the harpoons and lances lie levelled for use ; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole ; while from a sudden roll of the sea , the little craft stands half - erect out of the water , like a rearing horse . from the ship , the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies ; and to windward , a black cloud , rising up with earnest of squalls and rains , seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen . chapter 57 of whales in paint ; in teeth ; in wood ; in sheet - iron ; in stone ; in mountains ; in stars . on tower - hill , as you go down to the london docks , you may have seen a crippled beggar ( or kedger , as the sailors say ) holding a painted board before him , representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg . there are three whales and three boats ; and one of the boats ( presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity ) is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale . any time these ten years , they tell me , has that man held up that picture , and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world . but the time of his justification has now come . his three whales are as good whales as were ever published in wapping , at any rate ; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings . but , though for ever mounted on that stump , never a stump - speech does the poor whaleman make ; but , with downcast eyes , stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation . throughout the pacific , and also in nantucket , and new bedford , and sag harbor , you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling - scenes , graven by the fishermen themselves on sperm whale - teeth , or ladies \\' busks wrought out of the right whale - bone , and other like skrimshander articles , as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material , in their hours of ocean leisure . some of them have little boxes of dentistical - looking implements , specially intended for the skrimshandering business . but , in general , they toil with their jack - knives alone ; and , with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor , they will turn you out anything you please , in the way of a mariner \\' s fancy . long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which god placed him , i . e . what is called savagery . your true whale - hunter is as much a savage as an iroquois . i myself am a savage , owning no allegiance but to the king of the cannibals ; and ready at any moment to rebel against him . now , one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours , is his wonderful patience of industry . an ancient hawaiian war - club or spear - paddle , in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving , is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a latin lexicon . for , with but a bit of broken sea - shell or a shark \\' s tooth , that miraculous intricacy of wooden net - work has been achieved ; and it has cost steady years of steady application . as with the hawaiian savage , so with the white sailor - savage . with the same marvellous patience , and with the same single shark \\' s tooth , of his one poor jack - knife , he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture , not quite as workmanlike , but as close packed in its maziness of design , as the greek savage , achilles \\' s shield ; and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness , as the prints of that fine old dutch savage , albert durer . wooden whales , or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble south sea war - wood , are frequently met with in the forecastles of american whalers . some of them are done with much accuracy . at some old gable - roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road - side door . when the porter is sleepy , the anvil - headed whale would be best . but these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays . on the spires of some old - fashioned churches you will see sheet - iron whales placed there for weather - cocks ; but they are so elevated , and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with \" hands off !\" you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit . in bony , ribby regions of the earth , where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain , you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the leviathan partly merged in grass , which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges . then , again , in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights ; here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges . but you must be a thorough whaleman , to see these sights ; and not only that , but if you wish to return to such a sight again , you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand - point , else so chance - like are such observations of the hills , that your precise , previous stand - point would require a laborious re - discovery ; like the soloma islands , which still remain incognita , though once high - ruffed mendanna trod them and old figuera chronicled them . nor when expandingly lifted by your subject , can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens , and boats in pursuit of them ; as when long filled with thoughts of war the eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds . thus at the north have i chased leviathan round and round the pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me . and beneath the effulgent antarctic skies i have boarded the argo - navis , and joined the chase against the starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and the flying fish . with a frigate \\' s anchors for my bridle - bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs , would i could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies , to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight ! chapter 58 brit . steering north - eastward from the crozetts , we fell in with vast meadows of brit , the minute , yellow substance , upon which the right whale largely feeds . for leagues and leagues it undulated round us , so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat . on the second day , numbers of right whales were seen , who , secure from the attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod , with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit , which , adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous venetian blind in their mouths , was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip . as morning mowers , who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads ; even so these monsters swam , making a strange , grassy , cutting sound ; and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea .* * that part of the sea known among whalemen as the \" brazil banks \" does not bear that name as the banks of newfoundland do , because of there being shallows and soundings there , but because of this remarkable meadow - like appearance , caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes , where the right whale is often chased . but it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers . seen from the mast - heads , especially when they paused and were stationary for a while , their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else . and as in the great hunting countries of india , the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such , taking them for bare , blackened elevations of the soil ; even so , often , with him , who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea . and even when recognised at last , their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct , in all parts , with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse . indeed , in other respects , you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore . for though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea ; and though taking a broad general view of the thing , this may very well be ; yet coming to specialties , where , for example , does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog ? the accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him . but though , to landsmen in general , the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling ; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita , so that columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one ; though , by vast odds , the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters ; though but a moment \\' s consideration will teach , that however baby man may brag of his science and skill , and however much , in a flattering future , that science and skill may augment ; yet for ever and for ever , to the crack of doom , the sea will insult and murder him , and pulverize the stateliest , stiffest frigate he can make ; nevertheless , by the continual repetition of these very impressions , man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it . the first boat we read of , floated on an ocean , that with portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow . that same ocean rolls now ; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year . yea , foolish mortals , noah \\' s flood is not yet subsided ; two thirds of the fair world it yet covers . wherein differ the sea and the land , that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other ? preternatural terrors rested upon the hebrews , when under the feet of korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever ; yet not a modern sun ever sets , but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews . but not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it , but it is also a fiend to its own off - spring ; worse than the persian host who murdered his own guests ; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned . like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs , so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks , and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships . no mercy , no power but its own controls it . panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider , the masterless ocean overruns the globe . consider the subtleness of the sea ; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water , unapparent for the most part , and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure . consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes , as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks . consider , once more , the universal cannibalism of the sea ; all whose creatures prey upon each other , carrying on eternal war since the world began . consider all this ; and then turn to this green , gentle , and most docile earth ; consider them both , the sea and the land ; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself ? for as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land , so in the soul of man there lies one insular tahiti , full of peace and joy , but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life . god keep thee ! push not off from that isle , thou canst never return ! chapter 59 squid . slowly wading through the meadows of brit , the pequod still held on her way north - eastward towards the island of java ; a gentle air impelling her keel , so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze , as three mild palms on a plain . and still , at wide intervals in the silvery night , the lonely , alluring jet would be seen . but one transparent blue morning , when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea , however unattended with any stagnant calm ; when the long burnished sun - glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them , enjoining some secrecy ; when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on ; in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by daggoo from the main - mast - head . in the distance , a great white mass lazily rose , and rising higher and higher , and disentangling itself from the azure , at last gleamed before our prow like a snow - slide , new slid from the hills . thus glistening for a moment , as slowly it subsided , and sank . then once more arose , and silently gleamed . it seemed not a whale ; and yet is this moby dick ? thought daggoo . again the phantom went down , but on re - appearing once more , with a stiletto - like cry that startled every man from his nod , the negro yelled out --\" there ! there again ! there she breaches ! right ahead ! the white whale , the white whale !\" upon this , the seamen rushed to the yard - arms , as in swarming - time the bees rush to the boughs . bare - headed in the sultry sun , ahab stood on the bowsprit , and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman , cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of daggoo . whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon ahab , so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued ; however this was , or whether his eagerness betrayed him ; whichever way it might have been , no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass , than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering . the four boats were soon on the water ; ahab \\' s in advance , and all swiftly pulling towards their prey . soon it went down , and while , with oars suspended , we were awaiting its reappearance , lo ! in the same spot where it sank , once more it slowly rose . almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of moby dick , we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind . a vast pulpy mass , furlongs in length and breadth , of a glancing cream - colour , lay floating on the water , innumerable long arms radiating from its centre , and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas , as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach . no perceptible face or front did it have ; no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct ; but undulated there on the billows , an unearthly , formless , chance - like apparition of life . as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again , starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk , with a wild voice exclaimed --\" almost rather had i seen moby dick and fought him , than to have seen thee , thou white ghost !\" \" what was it , sir ?\" said flask . \" the great live squid , which , they say , few whale - ships ever beheld , and returned to their ports to tell of it .\" but ahab said nothing ; turning his boat , he sailed back to the vessel ; the rest as silently following . whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object , certain it is , that a glimpse of it being so very unusual , that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness . so rarely is it beheld , that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean , yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form ; notwithstanding , they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food . for though other species of whales find their food above water , and may be seen by man in the act of feeding , the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface ; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what , precisely , that food consists . at times , when closely pursued , he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid ; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length . they fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean ; and that the sperm whale , unlike other species , is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it . there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid . the manner in which the bishop describes it , as alternately rising and sinking , with some other particulars he narrates , in all this the two correspond . but much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it . by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature , here spoken of , it is included among the class of cuttle - fish , to which , indeed , in certain external respects it would seem to belong , but only as the anak of the tribe . chapter 60 the line . with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described , as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented , i have here to speak of the magical , sometimes horrible whale - line . the line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp , slightly vapoured with tar , not impregnated with it , as in the case of ordinary ropes ; for while tar , as ordinarily used , makes the hemp more pliable to the rope - maker , and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use ; yet , not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale - line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected ; but as most seamen are beginning to learn , tar in general by no means adds to the rope \\' s durability or strength , however much it may give it compactness and gloss . of late years the manilla rope has in the american fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale - lines ; for , though not so durable as hemp , it is stronger , and far more soft and elastic ; and i will add ( since there is an aesthetics in all things ), is much more handsome and becoming to the boat , than hemp . hemp is a dusky , dark fellow , a sort of indian ; but manilla is as a golden - haired circassian to behold . the whale - line is only two - thirds of an inch in thickness . at first sight , you would not think it so strong as it really is . by experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds ; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons . in length , the common sperm whale - line measures something over two hundred fathoms . towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub , not like the worm - pipe of a still though , but so as to form one round , cheese - shaped mass of densely bedded \" sheaves ,\" or layers of concentric spiralizations , without any hollow but the \" heart ,\" or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese . as the least tangle or kink in the coiling would , in running out , infallibly take somebody \\' s arm , leg , or entire body off , the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub . some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business , carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub , so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists . in the english boats two tubs are used instead of one ; the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs . there is some advantage in this ; because these twin - tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat , and do not strain it so much ; whereas , the american tub , nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth , makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half - inch in thickness ; for the bottom of the whale - boat is like critical ice , which will bear up a considerable distributed weight , but not very much of a concentrated one . when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american line - tub , the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding - cake to present to the whales . both ends of the line are exposed ; the lower end terminating in an eye - splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub , and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything . this arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts . first : in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat , in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon . in these instances , the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale , as it were , from the one boat to the other ; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort . second : this arrangement is indispensable for common safety \\' s sake ; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat , and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single , smoking minute as he sometimes does , he would not stop there , for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea ; and in that case no town - crier would ever find her again . before lowering the boat for the chase , the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub , and passing round the loggerhead there , is again carried forward the entire length of the boat , resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man \\' s oar , so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing ; and also passing between the men , as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales , to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat , where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill , prevents it from slipping out . from the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows , and is then passed inside the boat again ; and some ten or twenty fathoms ( called box - line ) being coiled upon the box in the bows , it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft , and is then attached to the short - warp -- the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon ; but previous to that connexion , the short - warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail . thus the whale - line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils , twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction . all the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions ; so that to the timid eye of the landsman , they seem as indian jugglers , with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs . nor can any son of mortal woman , for the first time , seat himself amid those hempen intricacies , and while straining his utmost at the oar , bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted , and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings ; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly . yet habit -- strange thing ! what cannot habit accomplish ?-- gayer sallies , more merry mirth , better jokes , and brighter repartees , you never heard over your mahogany , than you will hear over the half - inch white cedar of the whale - boat , when thus hung in hangman \\' s nooses ; and , like the six burghers of calais before king edward , the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death , with a halter around every neck , as you may say . perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters -- some few of which are casually chronicled -- of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line , and lost . for , when the line is darting out , to be seated then in the boat , is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam - engine in full play , when every flying beam , and shaft , and wheel , is grazing you . it is worse ; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils , because the boat is rocking like a cradle , and you are pitched one way and the other , without the slightest warning ; and only by a certain self - adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action , can you escape being made a mazeppa of , and run away with where the all - seeing sun himself could never pierce you out . again : as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm , is perhaps more awful than the storm itself ; for , indeed , the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm ; and contains it in itself , as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder , and the ball , and the explosion ; so the graceful repose of the line , as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play -- this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair . but why say more ? all men live enveloped in whale - lines . all are born with halters round their necks ; but it is only when caught in the swift , sudden turn of death , that mortals realize the silent , subtle , ever - present perils of life . and if you be a philosopher , though seated in the whale - boat , you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror , than though seated before your evening fire with a poker , and not a harpoon , by your side . chapter 61 stubb kills a whale . if to starbuck the apparition of the squid was a thing of portents , to queequeg it was quite a different object . \" when you see him \\' quid ,\" said the savage , honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat , \" then you quick see him \\' parm whale .\" the next day was exceedingly still and sultry , and with nothing special to engage them , the pequod \\' s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea . for this part of the indian ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground ; that is , it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises , dolphins , flying - fish , and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters , than those off the rio de la plata , or the in - shore ground off peru . it was my turn to stand at the foremast - head ; and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds , to and fro i idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air . no resolution could withstand it ; in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness , at last my soul went out of my body ; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will , long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn . ere forgetfulness altogether came over me , i had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzen - mast - heads were already drowsy . so that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars , and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman . the waves , too , nodded their indolent crests ; and across the wide trance of the sea , east nodded to west , and the sun over all . suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes ; like vices my hands grasped the shrouds ; some invisible , gracious agency preserved me ; with a shock i came back to life . and lo ! close under our lee , not forty fathoms off , a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate , his broad , glossy back , of an ethiopian hue , glistening in the sun \\' s rays like a mirror . but lazily undulating in the trough of the sea , and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet , the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon . but that pipe , poor whale , was thy last . as if struck by some enchanter \\' s wand , the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness ; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel , simultaneously with the three notes from aloft , shouted forth the accustomed cry , as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air . \" clear away the boats ! luff !\" cried ahab . and obeying his own order , he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes . the sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale ; and ere the boats were down , majestically turning , he swam away to the leeward , but with such a steady tranquillity , and making so few ripples as he swam , that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed , ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used , and no man must speak but in whispers . so seated like ontario indians on the gunwales of the boats , we swiftly but silently paddled along ; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set . presently , as we thus glided in chase , the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air , and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up . \" there go flukes !\" was the cry , an announcement immediately followed by stubb \\' s producing his match and igniting his pipe , for now a respite was granted . after the full interval of his sounding had elapsed , the whale rose again , and being now in advance of the smoker \\' s boat , and much nearer to it than to any of the others , stubb counted upon the honour of the capture . it was obvious , now , that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers . all silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use . paddles were dropped , and oars came loudly into play . and still puffing at his pipe , stubb cheered on his crew to the assault . yes , a mighty change had come over the fish . all alive to his jeopardy , he was going \" head out \"; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed .* * it will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale \\' s enormous head consists . though apparently the most massive , it is by far the most buoyant part about him . so that with ease he elevates it in the air , and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed . besides , such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head , and such the tapering cut - water formation of the lower part , that by obliquely elevating his head , he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff - bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed new york pilot - boat . \" start her , start her , my men ! don \\' t hurry yourselves ; take plenty of time -- but start her ; start her like thunder - claps , that \\' s all ,\" cried stubb , spluttering out the smoke as he spoke . \" start her , now ; give \\' em the long and strong stroke , tashtego . start her , tash , my boy -- start her , all ; but keep cool , keep cool -- cucumbers is the word -- easy , easy -- only start her like grim death and grinning devils , and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves , boys -- that \\' s all . start her !\" \" woo - hoo ! wa - hee !\" screamed the gay - header in reply , raising some old war - whoop to the skies ; as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager indian gave . but his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild . \" kee - hee ! kee - hee !\" yelled daggoo , straining forwards and backwards on his seat , like a pacing tiger in his cage . \" ka - la ! koo - loo !\" howled queequeg , as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of grenadier \\' s steak . and thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea . meanwhile , stubb retaining his place in the van , still encouraged his men to the onset , all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth . like desperadoes they tugged and they strained , till the welcome cry was heard --\" stand up , tashtego !-- give it to him !\" the harpoon was hurled . \" stern all !\" the oarsmen backed water ; the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists . it was the magical line . an instant before , stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead , whence , by reason of its increased rapid circlings , a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe . as the line passed round and round the loggerhead ; so also , just before reaching that point , it blisteringly passed through and through both of stubb \\' s hands , from which the hand - cloths , or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times , had accidentally dropped . it was like holding an enemy \\' s sharp two - edged sword by the blade , and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch . \" wet the line ! wet the line !\" cried stubb to the tub oarsman ( him seated by the tub ) who , snatching off his hat , dashed sea - water into it .* more turns were taken , so that the line began holding its place . the boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins . stubb and tashtego here changed places -- stem for stern -- a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion . * partly to show the indispensableness of this act , it may here be stated , that , in the old dutch fishery , a mop was used to dash the running line with water ; in many other ships , a wooden piggin , or bailer , is set apart for that purpose . your hat , however , is the most convenient . from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat , and from its now being more tight than a harpstring , you would have thought the craft had two keels -- one cleaving the water , the other the air -- as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once . a continual cascade played at the bows ; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake ; and , at the slightest motion from within , even but of a little finger , the vibrating , cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea . thus they rushed ; each man with might and main clinging to his seat , to prevent being tossed to the foam ; and the tall form of tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double , in order to bring down his centre of gravity . whole atlantics and pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way , till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight . \" haul in -- haul in !\" cried stubb to the bowsman ! and , facing round towards the whale , all hands began pulling the boat up to him , while yet the boat was being towed on . soon ranging up by his flank , stubb , firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat , darted dart after dart into the flying fish ; at the word of command , the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale \\' s horrible wallow , and then ranging up for another fling . the red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill . his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood , which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake . the slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea , sent back its reflection into every face , so that they all glowed to each other like red men . and all the while , jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale , and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman ; as at every dart , hauling in upon his crooked lance ( by the line attached to it ), stubb straightened it again and again , by a few rapid blows against the gunwale , then again and again sent it into the whale . \" pull up -- pull up !\" he now cried to the bowsman , as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath . \" pull up !-- close to !\" and the boat ranged along the fish \\' s flank . when reaching far over the bow , stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish , and kept it there , carefully churning and churning , as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed , and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out . but that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish . and now it is struck ; for , starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his \" flurry ,\" the monster horribly wallowed in his blood , overwrapped himself in impenetrable , mad , boiling spray , so that the imperilled craft , instantly dropping astern , had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day . and now abating in his flurry , the whale once more rolled out into view ; surging from side to side ; spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout - hole , with sharp , cracking , agonized respirations . at last , gush after gush of clotted red gore , as if it had been the purple lees of red wine , shot into the frighted air ; and falling back again , ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea . his heart had burst ! \" he \\' s dead , mr . stubb ,\" said daggoo . \" yes ; both pipes smoked out !\" and withdrawing his own from his mouth , stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water ; and , for a moment , stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made . chapter 62 the dart . a word concerning an incident in the last chapter . according to the invariable usage of the fishery , the whale - boat pushes off from the ship , with the headsman or whale - killer as temporary steersman , and the harpooneer or whale - fastener pulling the foremost oar , the one known as the harpooneer - oar . now it needs a strong , nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish ; for often , in what is called a long dart , the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet . but however prolonged and exhausting the chase , the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost ; indeed , he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest , not only by incredible rowing , but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations ; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one \\' s compass , while all the other muscles are strained and half started -- what that is none know but those who have tried it . for one , i cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time . in this straining , bawling state , then , with his back to the fish , all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry --\" stand up , and give it to him !\" he now has to drop and secure his oar , turn round on his centre half way , seize his harpoon from the crotch , and with what little strength may remain , he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale . no wonder , taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body , that out of fifty fair chances for a dart , not five are successful ; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated ; no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood - vessels in the boat ; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels ; no wonder that to many ship owners , whaling is but a losing concern ; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage , and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted ! again , if the dart be successful , then at the second critical instant , that is , when the whale starts to run , the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft , to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else . it is then they change places ; and the headsman , the chief officer of the little craft , takes his proper station in the bows of the boat . now , i care not who maintains the contrary , but all this is both foolish and unnecessary . the headsman should stay in the bows from first to last ; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance , and no rowing whatever should be expected of him , except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman . i know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase ; but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery , it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them . to insure the greatest efficiency in the dart , the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness , and not from out of toil . chapter 63 the crotch . out of the trunk , the branches grow ; out of them , the twigs . so , in productive subjects , grow the chapters . the crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention . it is a notched stick of a peculiar form , some two feet in length , which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow , for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon , whose other naked , barbed end slopingly projects from the prow . thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler , who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall . it is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch , respectively called the first and second irons . but these two harpoons , each by its own cord , are both connected with the line ; the object being this : to dart them both , if possible , one instantly after the other into the same whale ; so that if , in the coming drag , one should draw out , the other may still retain a hold . it is a doubling of the chances . but it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous , violent , convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron , it becomes impossible for the harpooneer , however lightning - like in his movements , to pitch the second iron into him . nevertheless , as the second iron is already connected with the line , and the line is running , hence that weapon must , at all events , be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat , somehow and somewhere ; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands . tumbled into the water , it accordingly is in such cases ; the spare coils of box line ( mentioned in a preceding chapter ) making this feat , in most instances , prudently practicable . but this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties . furthermore : you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard , it thenceforth becomes a dangling , sharp - edged terror , skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale , entangling the lines , or cutting them , and making a prodigious sensation in all directions . nor , in general , is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse . consider , now , how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong , active , and knowing whale ; when owing to these qualities in him , as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise , eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him . for , of course , each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery . all these particulars are faithfully narrated here , as they will not fail to elucidate several most important , however intricate passages , in scenes hereafter to be painted . chapter 64 stubb \\' s supper . stubb \\' s whale had been killed some distance from the ship . it was a calm ; so , forming a tandem of three boats , we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the pequod . and now , as we eighteen men with our thirty - six arms , and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers , slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert , sluggish corpse in the sea ; and it seemed hardly to budge at all , except at long intervals ; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved . for , upon the great canal of hang - ho , or whatever they call it , in china , four or five laborers on the foot - path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour ; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along , as if laden with pig - lead in bulk . darkness came on ; but three lights up and down in the pequod \\' s main - rigging dimly guided our way ; till drawing nearer we saw ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks . vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment , he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night , and then handing his lantern to a seaman , went his way into the cabin , and did not come forward again until morning . though , in overseeing the pursuit of this whale , captain ahab had evinced his customary activity , to call it so ; yet now that the creature was dead , some vague dissatisfaction , or impatience , or despair , seemed working in him ; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that moby dick was yet to be slain ; and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship , all that would not one jot advance his grand , monomaniac object . very soon you would have thought from the sound on the pequod \\' s decks , that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep ; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck , and thrust rattling out of the port - holes . but by those clanking links , the vast corpse itself , not the ship , is to be moored . tied by the head to the stern , and by the tail to the bows , the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel \\' s and seen through the darkness of the night , which obscured the spars and rigging aloft , the two -- ship and whale , seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks , whereof one reclines while the other remains standing .* * a little item may as well be related here . the strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside , is by the flukes or tail ; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other ( excepting the side - fins ), its flexibility even in death , causes it to sink low beneath the surface ; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat , in order to put the chain round it . but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome : a small , strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end , and a weight in its middle , while the other end is secured to the ship . by adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass , so that now having girdled the whale , the chain is readily made to follow suit ; and being slipped along the body , is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail , at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes . if moody ahab was now all quiescence , at least so far as could be known on deck , stubb , his second mate , flushed with conquest , betrayed an unusual but still good - natured excitement . such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid starbuck , his official superior , quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs . one small , helping cause of all this liveliness in stubb , was soon made strangely manifest . stubb was a high liver ; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate . \" a steak , a steak , ere i sleep ! you , daggoo ! overboard you go , and cut me one from his small !\" here be it known , that though these wild fishermen do not , as a general thing , and according to the great military maxim , make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war ( at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage ), yet now and then you find some of these nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale designated by stubb ; comprising the tapering extremity of the body . about midnight that steak was cut and cooked ; and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil , stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan - head , as if that capstan were a sideboard . nor was stubb the only banqueter on whale \\' s flesh that night . mingling their mumblings with his own mastications , thousands on thousands of sharks , swarming round the dead leviathan , smackingly feasted on its fatness . the few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull , within a few inches of the sleepers \\' hearts . peering over the side you could just see them ( as before you heard them ) wallowing in the sullen , black waters , and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head . this particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous . how at such an apparently unassailable surface , they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls , remains a part of the universal problem of all things . the mark they thus leave on the whale , may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw . though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea - fight , sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship \\' s decks , like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved , ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them ; and though , while the valiant butchers over the deck - table are thus cannibally carving each other \\' s live meat with carving - knives all gilded and tasselled , the sharks , also , with their jewel - hilted mouths , are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat ; and though , were you to turn the whole affair upside down , it would still be pretty much the same thing , that is to say , a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties ; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the atlantic , systematically trotting alongside , to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere , or a dead slave to be decently buried ; and though one or two other like instances might be set down , touching the set terms , places , and occasions , when sharks do most socially congregate , and most hilariously feast ; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers , and in gayer or more jovial spirits , than around a dead sperm whale , moored by night to a whaleship at sea . if you have never seen that sight , then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil - worship , and the expediency of conciliating the devil . but , as yet , stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so nigh him , no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips . \" cook , cook !-- where \\' s that old fleece ?\" he cried at length , widening his legs still further , as if to form a more secure base for his supper ; and , at the same time darting his fork into the dish , as if stabbing with his lance ; \" cook , you cook !-- sail this way , cook !\" the old black , not in any very high glee at having been previously roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour , came shambling along from his galley , for , like many old blacks , there was something the matter with his knee - pans , which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans ; this old fleece , as they called him , came shuffling and limping along , assisting his step with his tongs , which , after a clumsy fashion , were made of straightened iron hoops ; this old ebony floundered along , and in obedience to the word of command , came to a dead stop on the opposite side of stubb \\' s sideboard ; when , with both hands folded before him , and resting on his two - legged cane , he bowed his arched back still further over , at the same time sideways inclining his head , so as to bring his best ear into play . \" cook ,\" said stubb , rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth , \" don \\' t you think this steak is rather overdone ? you \\' ve been beating this steak too much , cook ; it \\' s too tender . don \\' t i always say that to be good , a whale - steak must be tough ? there are those sharks now over the side , don \\' t you see they prefer it tough and rare ? what a shindy they are kicking up ! cook , go and talk to \\' em ; tell \\' em they are welcome to help themselves civilly , and in moderation , but they must keep quiet . blast me , if i can hear my own voice . away , cook , and deliver my message . here , take this lantern ,\" snatching one from his sideboard ; \" now then , go and preach to \\' em !\" sullenly taking the offered lantern , old fleece limped across the deck to the bulwarks ; and then , with one hand dropping his light low over the sea , so as to get a good view of his congregation , with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs , and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks , while stubb , softly crawling behind , overheard all that was said . \" fellow - critters : i \\' se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare . you hear ? stop dat dam smackin \\' ob de lips ! massa stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings , but by gor ! you must stop dat dam racket !\" \" cook ,\" here interposed stubb , accompanying the word with a sudden slap on the shoulder ,--\" cook ! why , damn your eyes , you mustn \\' t swear that way when you \\' re preaching . that \\' s no way to convert sinners , cook !\" \" who dat ? den preach to him yourself ,\" sullenly turning to go . \" no , cook ;

fill your dam bellies \\' till dey bust -- and den die .\" \" now , cook ,\" said stubb , resuming his supper at the capstan ; \" stand just where you stood before , there , over against me , and pay particular attention .\" \" all \\' dention ,\" said fleece , again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position . \" well ,\" said stubb , helping himself freely meanwhile ; \" i shall now go back to the subject of this steak . in the first place , how old are you , cook ?\" \" what dat do wid de \\' teak ,\" said the old black , testily . \" silence ! how old are you , cook ?\" \"\\' bout ninety , dey say ,\" he gloomily muttered . \" and you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years , cook , and don \\' t know yet how to cook a whale - steak ?\" rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word , so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question . \" where were you born , cook ?\" \"\\' hind de hatchway , in ferry - boat , goin \\' ober de roanoke .\" \" born in a ferry - boat ! that \\' s queer , too . but i want to know what country you were born in , cook !\" \" didn \\' t i say de roanoke country ?\" he cried sharply . \" no , you didn \\' t , cook ; but i \\' ll tell you what i \\' m coming to , cook . you must go home and be born over again ; you don \\' t know how to cook a whale - steak yet .\" \" bress my soul , if i cook noder one ,\" he growled , angrily , turning round to depart . \" come back here , cook ;-- here , hand me those tongs ;-- now take that bit of steak there , and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be ? take it , i say \"-- holding the tongs towards him --\" take it , and taste it .\" faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment , the old negro muttered , \" best cooked \\' teak i eber taste ; joosy , berry joosy .\" \" cook ,\" said stubb , squaring himself once more ; \" do you belong to the church ?\" \" passed one once in cape - down ,\" said the old man sullenly . \" and you have once in your life passed a holy church in cape - town , where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellow - creatures , have you , cook ! and yet you come here , and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now , eh ?\" said stubb . \" where do you expect to go to , cook ?\" \" go to bed berry soon ,\" he mumbled , half - turning as he spoke . \" avast ! heave to ! i mean when you die , cook . it \\' s an awful question . now what \\' s your answer ?\" \" when dis old brack man dies ,\" said the negro slowly , changing his whole air and demeanor , \" he hisself won \\' t go nowhere ; but some bressed angel will come and fetch him .\" \" fetch him ? how ? in a coach and four , as they fetched elijah ? and fetch him where ?\" \" up dere ,\" said fleece , holding his tongs straight over his head , and keeping it there very solemnly . \" so , then , you expect to go up into our main - top , do you , cook , when you are dead ? but don \\' t you know the higher you climb , the colder it gets ? main - top , eh ?\" \" didn \\' t say dat t \\' all ,\" said fleece , again in the sulks . \" you said up there , didn \\' t you ? and now look yourself , and see where your tongs are pointing . but , perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber \\' s hole , cook ;

you see that , don \\' t you ? well , for the future , when you cook another whale - steak for my private table here , the capstan , i \\' ll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing . hold the steak in one hand , and show a live coal to it with the other ; that done , dish it ; d \\' ye hear ? and now to - morrow , cook , when we are cutting in the fish , be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins ; have them put in pickle . as for the ends of the flukes , have them soused , cook . there , now ye may go .\" but fleece had hardly got three paces off , when he was recalled . \" cook , give me cutlets for supper to - morrow night in the mid - watch . d \\' ye hear ? away you sail , then .-- halloa ! stop ! make a bow before you go .-- avast heaving again ! whale - balls for breakfast -- don \\' t forget .\" \" wish , by gor ! whale eat him , \\' stead of him eat whale . i \\' m bressed if he ain \\' t more of shark dan massa shark hisself ,\" muttered the old man , limping away ; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock . chapter 65 the whale as a dish . that mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp , and , like stubb , eat him by his own light , as you may say ; this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it . it is upon record , that three centuries ago the tongue of the right whale was esteemed a great delicacy in france , and commanded large prices there . also , that in henry viiith \\' s time , a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises , which , you remember , are a species of whale . porpoises , indeed , are to this day considered fine eating . the meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls , and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle - balls or veal balls . the old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them . they had a great porpoise grant from the crown . the fact is , that among his hunters at least , the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish , were there not so much of him ; but when you come to sit down before a meat - pie nearly one hundred feet long , it takes away your appetite . only the most unprejudiced of men like stubb , nowadays partake of cooked whales ; but the esquimaux are not so fastidious . we all know how they live upon whales , and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil . zogranda , one of their most famous doctors , recommends strips of blubber for infants , as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing . and this reminds me that certain englishmen , who long ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vessel -- that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber . among the dutch whalemen these scraps are called \" fritters \"; which , indeed , they greatly resemble , being brown and crisp , and smelling something like old amsterdam housewives \\' dough - nuts or oly - cooks , when fresh . they have such an eatable look that the most self - denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off . but what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish , is his exceeding richness . he is the great prize ox of the sea , too fat to be delicately good . look at his hump , which would be as fine eating as the buffalo \\' s ( which is esteemed a rare dish ), were it not such a solid pyramid of fat . but the spermaceti itself , how bland and creamy that is ; like the transparent , half - jellied , white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth , yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter . nevertheless , many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance , and then partaking of it . in the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship - biscuit into the huge oil - pots and let them fry there awhile . many a good supper have i thus made . in the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a fine dish . the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe , and the two plump , whitish lobes being withdrawn ( precisely resembling two large puddings ), they are then mixed with flour , and cooked into a most delectable mess , in flavor somewhat resembling calves \\' head , which is quite a dish among some epicures ; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures , by continually dining upon calves \\' brains , by and by get to have a little brains of their own , so as to be able to tell a calf \\' s head from their own heads ; which , indeed , requires uncommon discrimination . and that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf \\' s head before him , is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see . the head looks a sort of reproachfully at him , with an \" et tu brute !\" expression . it is not , perhaps , entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence ; that appears to result , in some way , from the consideration before mentioned : i . e . that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea , and eat it too by its own light . but no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer ; perhaps he was hung ; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen , he certainly would have been ; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does . go to the meat - market of a saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds . does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal \\' s jaw ? cannibals ? who is not a cannibal ? i tell you it will be more tolerable for the fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine ; it will be more tolerable for that provident fejee , i say , in the day of judgment , than for thee , civilized and enlightened gourmand , who nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy pate - de - foie - gras . but stubb , he eats the whale by its own light , does he ? and that is adding insult to injury , is it ? look at your knife - handle , there , my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef , what is that handle made of ?-- what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating ? and what do you pick your teeth with , after devouring that fat goose ? with a feather of the same fowl . and with what quill did the secretary of the society for the suppression of cruelty to ganders formally indite his circulars ? it is only within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronise nothing but steel pens . chapter 66 the shark massacre . when in the southern fishery , a captured sperm whale , after long and weary toil , is brought alongside late at night , it is not , as a general thing at least , customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in . for that business is an exceedingly laborious one ; is not very soon completed ; and requires all hands to set about it . therefore , the common usage is to take in all sail ; lash the helm a \\' lee ; and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight , with the reservation that , until that time , anchor - watches shall be kept ; that is , two and two for an hour , each couple , the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well . but sometimes , especially upon the line in the pacific , this plan will not answer at all ; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the moored carcase , that were he left so for six hours , say , on a stretch , little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning . in most other parts of the ocean , however , where these fish do not so largely abound , their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished , by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling - spades , a procedure notwithstanding , which , in some instances , only seems to tickle them into still greater activity . but it was not thus in the present case with the pequod \\' s sharks ; though , to be sure , any man unaccustomed to such sights , to have looked over her side that night , would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese , and those sharks the maggots in it . nevertheless , upon stubb setting the anchor - watch after his supper was concluded ; and when , accordingly , queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck , no small excitement was created among the sharks ; for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side , and lowering three lanterns , so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea , these two mariners , darting their long whaling - spades , kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks ,* by striking the keen steel deep into their skulls , seemingly their only vital part . but in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts , the marksmen could not always hit their mark ; and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe . they viciously snapped , not only at each other \\' s disembowelments , but like flexible bows , bent round , and bit their own ; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth , to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound . nor was this all . it was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures . a sort of generic or pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones , after what might be called the individual life had departed . killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin , one of these sharks almost took poor queequeg \\' s hand off , when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw . * the whaling - spade used for cutting - in is made of the very best steel ; is about the bigness of a man \\' s spread hand ; and in general shape , corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named ; only its sides are perfectly flat , and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower . this weapon is always kept as sharp as possible ; and when being used is occasionally honed , just like a razor . in its socket , a stiff pole , from twenty to thirty feet long , is inserted for a handle . \" queequeg no care what god made him shark ,\" said the savage , agonizingly lifting his hand up and down ; \" wedder fejee god or nantucket god ; but de god wat made shark must be one dam ingin .\" chapter 67 cutting in . it was a saturday night , and such a sabbath as followed ! ex officio professors of sabbath breaking are all whalemen . the ivory pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble ; every sailor a butcher . you would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods . in the first place , the enormous cutting tackles , among other ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green , and which no single man can possibly lift -- this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main - top and firmly lashed to the lower mast - head , the strongest point anywhere above a ship \\' s deck . the end of the hawser - like rope winding through these intricacies , was then conducted to the windlass , and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale ; to this block the great blubber hook , weighing some one hundred pounds , was attached . and now suspended in stages over the side , starbuck and stubb , the mates , armed with their long spades , began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side - fins . this done , a broad , semicircular line is cut round the hole , the hook is inserted , and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus , now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass . when instantly , the entire ship careens over on her side ; every bolt in her starts like the nail - heads of an old house in frosty weather ; she trembles , quivers , and nods her frighted mast - heads to the sky . more and more she leans over to the whale , while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows ; till at last , a swift , startling snap is heard ; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale , and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber . now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange , so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it . for the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water , and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the \" scarf ,\" simultaneously cut by the spades of starbuck and stubb , the mates ; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off , and indeed by that very act itself , it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main - top ; the men at the windlass then cease heaving , and for a moment or two the prodigious blood - dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky , and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings , else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard . one of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long , keen weapon called a boarding - sword , and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass . into this hole , the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber , in order to prepare for what follows . whereupon , this accomplished swordsman , warning all hands to stand off , once more makes a scientific dash at the mass , and with a few sidelong , desperate , lunging slicings , severs it completely in twain ; so that while the short lower part is still fast , the long upper strip , called a blanket - piece , swings clear , and is all ready for lowering . the heavers forward now resume their song , and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale , the other is slowly slackened away , and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath , into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber - room . into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket - piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents . and thus the work proceeds ; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously ; both whale and windlass heaving , the heavers singing , the blubber - room gentlemen coiling , the mates scarfing , the ship straining , and all hands swearing occasionally , by way of assuaging the general friction . chapter 68 the blanket . i have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject , the skin of the whale . i have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat , and learned naturalists ashore . my original opinion remains unchanged ; but it is only an opinion . the question is , what and where is the skin of the whale ? already you know what his blubber is . that blubber is something of the consistence of firm , close - grained beef , but tougher , more elastic and compact , and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness . now , however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature \\' s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness , yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption ; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale \\' s body but that same blubber ; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal , if reasonably dense , what can that be but the skin ? true , from the unmarred dead body of the whale , you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin , transparent substance , somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass , only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin ; that is , previous to being dried , when it not only contracts and thickens , but becomes rather hard and brittle . i have several such dried bits , which i use for marks in my whale - books . it is transparent , as i said before ; and being laid upon the printed page , i have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence . at any rate , it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles , as you may say . but what i am driving at here is this . that same infinitely thin , isinglass substance , which , i admit , invests the entire body of the whale , is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature , as the skin of the skin , so to speak ; for it were simply ridiculous to say , that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new - born child . but no more of this . assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale ; then , when this skin , as in the case of a very large sperm whale , will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil ; and , when it is considered that , in quantity , or rather weight , that oil , in its expressed state , is only three fourths , and not the entire substance of the coat ; some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass , a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that . reckoning ten barrels to the ton , you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale \\' s skin . in life , the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents . almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re - crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array , something like those in the finest italian line engravings . but these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned , but seem to be seen through it , as if they were engraved upon the body itself . nor is this all . in some instances , to the quick , observant eye , those linear marks , as in a veritable engraving , but afford the ground for far other delineations . these are hieroglyphical ; that is , if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics , then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion . by my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one sperm whale in particular , i was much struck with a plate representing the old indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the upper mississippi . like those mystic rocks , too , the mystic - marked whale remains undecipherable . this allusion to the indian rocks reminds me of another thing . besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the sperm whale presents , he not seldom displays the back , and more especially his flanks , effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance , by reason of numerous rude scratches , altogether of an irregular , random aspect . i should say that those new england rocks on the sea - coast , which agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs -- i should say , that those rocks must not a little resemble the sperm whale in this particular . it also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales ; for i have most remarked them in the large , full - grown bulls of the species . a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale . it has already been said , that it is stript from him in long pieces , called blanket - pieces . like most sea - terms , this one is very happy and significant . for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane ; or , still better , an indian poncho slipt over his head , and skirting his extremity . it is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body , that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers , in all seas , times , and tides . what would become of a greenland whale , say , in those shuddering , icy seas of the north , if unsupplied with his cosy surtout ? true , other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean waters ; but these , be it observed , are your cold - blooded , lungless fish , whose very bellies are refrigerators ; creatures , that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg , as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire ; whereas , like man , the whale has lungs and warm blood . freeze his blood , and he dies . how wonderful is it then -- except after explanation -- that this great monster , to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man ; how wonderful that he should be found at home , immersed to his lips for life in those arctic waters ! where , when seamen fall overboard , they are sometimes found , months afterwards , perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice , as a fly is found glued in amber . but more surprising is it to know , as has been proved by experiment , that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than that of a borneo negro in summer . it does seem to me , that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality , and the rare virtue of thick walls , and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness . oh , man ! admire and model thyself after the whale ! do thou , too , remain warm among ice . do thou , too , live in this world without being of it . be cool at the equator ; keep thy blood fluid at the pole . like the great dome of st . peter \\' s , and like the great whale , retain , o man ! in all seasons a temperature of thine own . but how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things ! of erections , how few are domed like st . peter \\' s ! of creatures , how few vast as the whale ! chapter 69 the funeral . haul in the chains ! let the carcase go astern ! the vast tackles have now done their duty . the peeled white body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre ; though changed in hue , it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk . it is still colossal . slowly it floats more and more away , the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks , and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls , whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the whale . the vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the ship , and every rod that it so floats , what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls , augment the murderous din . for hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen . beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky , upon the fair face of the pleasant sea , wafted by the joyous breezes , that great mass of death floats on and on , till lost in infinite perspectives . there \\' s a most doleful and most mocking funeral ! the sea - vultures all in pious mourning , the air - sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled . in life but few of them would have helped the whale , i ween , if peradventure he had needed it ; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce . oh , horrible vultureism of earth ! from which not the mightiest whale is free . nor is this the end . desecrated as the body is , a vengeful ghost survives and hovers over it to scare . espied by some timid man - of - war or blundering discovery - vessel from afar , when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls , nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun , and the white spray heaving high against it ; straightway the whale \\' s unharming corpse , with trembling fingers is set down in the log -- shoals , rocks , and breakers hereabouts : beware ! and for years afterwards , perhaps , ships shun the place ; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum , because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held . there \\' s your law of precedents ; there \\' s your utility of traditions ; there \\' s the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth , and now not even hovering in the air ! there \\' s orthodoxy ! thus , while in life the great whale \\' s body may have been a real terror to his foes , in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world . are you a believer in ghosts , my friend ? there are other ghosts than the cock - lane one , and far deeper men than doctor johnson who believe in them . chapter 70 the sphynx . it should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the leviathan , he was beheaded . now , the beheading of the sperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat , upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves : and not without reason . consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck ; on the contrary , where his head and body seem to join , there , in that very place , is the thickest part of him . remember , also , that the surgeon must operate from above , some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject , and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured , rolling , and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea . bear in mind , too , that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh ; and in that subterraneous manner , without so much as getting one single peep into the ever - contracting gash thus made , he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent , interdicted parts , and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull . do you not marvel , then , at stubb \\' s boast , that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale ? when first severed , the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped . that done , if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of . but , with a full grown leviathan this is impossible ; for the sperm whale \\' s head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk , and completely to suspend such a burden as that , even by the immense tackles of a whaler , this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a dutch barn in jewellers \\' scales . the pequod \\' s whale being decapitated and the body stripped , the head was hoisted against the ship \\' s side -- about half way out of the sea , so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element . and there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it , by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast - head , and every yard - arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves ; there , that blood - dripping head hung to the pequod \\' s waist like the giant holofernes \\' s from the girdle of judith . when this last task was accomplished it was noon , and the seamen went below to their dinner . silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck . an intense copper calm , like a universal yellow lotus , was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea . a short space elapsed , and up into this noiselessness came ahab alone from his cabin . taking a few turns on the quarter - deck , he paused to gaze over the side , then slowly getting into the main - chains he took stubb \\' s long spade -- still remaining there after the whale \\' s decapitation -- and striking it into the lower part of the half - suspended mass , placed its other end crutch - wise under one arm , and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head . it was a black and hooded head ; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm , it seemed the sphynx \\' s in the desert . \" speak , thou vast and venerable head ,\" muttered ahab , \" which , though ungarnished with a beard , yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses ; speak , mighty head , and tell us the secret thing that is in thee . of all divers , thou hast dived the deepest . that head upon which the upper sun now gleams , has moved amid this world \\' s foundations . where unrecorded names and navies rust , and untold hopes and anchors rot ; where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned ; there , in that awful water - land , there was thy most familiar home . thou hast been where bell or diver never went ; hast slept by many a sailor \\' s side , where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down . thou saw \\' st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship ; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave ; true to each other , when heaven seemed false to them . thou saw \\' st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck ; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw ; and his murderers still sailed on unharmed -- while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched , longing arms . o head ! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of abraham , and not one syllable is thine !\" \" sail ho !\" cried a triumphant voice from the main - mast - head . \" aye ? well , now , that \\' s cheering ,\" cried ahab , suddenly erecting himself , while whole thunder - clouds swept aside from his brow . \" that lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better man .-- where away ?\" \" three points on the starboard bow , sir , and bringing down her breeze to us ! \" better and better , man . would now st . paul would come along that way , and to my breezelessness bring his breeze ! o nature , and o soul of man ! how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies ! not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter , but has its cunning duplicate in mind .\" chapter 71 the jeroboam \\' s story . hand in hand , ship and breeze blew on ; but the breeze came faster than the ship , and soon the pequod began to rock . by and by , through the glass the stranger \\' s boats and manned mast - heads proved her a whale - ship . but as she was so far to windward , and shooting by , apparently making a passage to some other ground , the pequod could not hope to reach her . so the signal was set to see what response would be made . here be it said , that like the vessels of military marines , the ships of the american whale fleet have each a private signal ; all which signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached , every captain is provided with it . thereby , the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean , even at considerable distances and with no small facility . the pequod \\' s signal was at last responded to by the stranger \\' s setting her own ; which proved the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucket . squaring her yards , she bore down , ranged abeam under the pequod \\' s lee , and lowered a boat ; it soon drew nigh ; but , as the side - ladder was being rigged by starbuck \\' s order to accommodate the visiting captain , the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat \\' s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary . it turned out that the jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board , and that mayhew , her captain , was fearful of infecting the pequod \\' s company . for , though himself and boat \\' s crew remained untainted , and though his ship was half a rifle - shot off , and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between ; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land , he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the pequod . but this did by no means prevent all communications . preserving an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship , the jeroboam \\' s boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the pequod , as she heavily forged through the sea ( for by this time it blew very fresh ), with her main - topsail aback ; though , indeed , at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave , the boat would be pushed some way ahead ; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again . subject to this , and other the like interruptions now and then , a conversation was sustained between the two parties ; but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort . pulling an oar in the jeroboam \\' s boat , was a man of a singular appearance , even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities . he was a small , short , youngish man , sprinkled all over his face with freckles , and wearing redundant yellow hair . a long - skirted , cabalistically - cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him ; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists . a deep , settled , fanatic delirium was in his eyes . so soon as this figure had been first descried , stubb had exclaimed --\" that \\' s he ! that \\' s he !-- the long - togged scaramouch the town - ho \\' s company told us of !\" stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the jeroboam , and a certain man among her crew , some time previous when the pequod spoke the town - ho . according to this account and what was subsequently learned , it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the jeroboam . his story was this : he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeuna shakers , where he had been a great prophet ; in their cracked , secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trap - door , announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial , which he carried in his vest - pocket ; but , which , instead of containing gunpowder , was supposed to be charged with laudanum . a strange , apostolic whim having seized him , he had left neskyeuna for nantucket , where , with that cunning peculiar to craziness , he assumed a steady , common - sense exterior , and offered himself as a green - hand candidate for the jeroboam \\' s whaling voyage . they engaged him ; but straightway upon the ship \\' s getting out of sight of land , his insanity broke out in a freshet . he announced himself as the archangel gabriel , and commanded the captain to jump overboard . he published his manifesto , whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar - general of all oceanica . the unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things ;-- the dark , daring play of his sleepless , excited imagination , and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium , united to invest this gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew , with an atmosphere of sacredness . moreover , they were afraid of him . as such a man , however , was not of much practical use in the ship , especially as he refused to work except when he pleased , the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him ; but apprised that that individual \\' s intention was to land him in the first convenient port , the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials -- devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition , in case this intention was carried out . so strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew , that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if gabriel was sent from the ship , not a man of them would remain . he was therefore forced to relinquish his plan . nor would they permit gabriel to be any way maltreated , say or do what he would ; so that it came to pass that gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship . the consequence of all this was , that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates ; and since the epidemic had broken out , he carried a higher hand than ever ; declaring that the plague , as he called it , was at his sole command ; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure . the sailors , mostly poor devils , cringed , and some of them fawned before him ; in obedience to his instructions , sometimes rendering him personal homage , as to a god . such things may seem incredible ; but , however wondrous , they are true . nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the measureless self - deception of the fanatic himself , as his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others . but it is time to return to the pequod . \" i fear not thy epidemic , man ,\" said ahab from the bulwarks , to captain mayhew , who stood in the boat \\' s stern ; \" come on board .\" but now gabriel started to his feet . \" think , think of the fevers , yellow and bilious ! beware of the horrible plague !\" \" gabriel ! gabriel !\" cried captain mayhew ; \" thou must either --\" but that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead , and its seethings drowned all speech . \" hast thou seen the white whale ?\" demanded ahab , when the boat drifted back . \" think , think of thy whale - boat , stoven and sunk ! beware of the horrible tail !\" \" i tell thee again , gabriel , that --\" but again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends . nothing was said for some moments , while a succession of riotous waves rolled by , which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling , not heaving it . meantime , the hoisted sperm whale \\' s head jogged about very violently , and gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant . when this interlude was over , captain mayhew began a dark story concerning moby dick ; not , however , without frequent interruptions from gabriel , whenever his name was mentioned , and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him . it seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home , when upon speaking a whale - ship , her people were reliably apprised of the existence of moby dick , and the havoc he had made . greedily sucking in this intelligence , gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the white whale , in case the monster should be seen ; in his gibbering insanity , pronouncing the white whale to be no less a being than the shaker god incarnated ; the shakers receiving the bible . but when , some year or two afterwards , moby dick was fairly sighted from the mast - heads , macey , the chief mate , burned with ardour to encounter him ; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity , despite all the archangel \\' s denunciations and forewarnings , macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat . with them he pushed off ; and , after much weary pulling , and many perilous , unsuccessful onsets , he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast . meantime , gabriel , ascending to the main - royal mast - head , was tossing one arm in frantic gestures , and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity . now , while macey , the mate , was standing up in his boat \\' s bow , and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale , and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance , lo ! a broad white shadow rose from the sea ; by its quick , fanning motion , temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen . next instant , the luckless mate , so full of furious life , was smitten bodily into the air , and making a long arc in his descent , fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards . not a chip of the boat was harmed , nor a hair of any oarsman \\' s head ; but the mate for ever sank . it is well to parenthesize here , that of the fatal accidents in the sperm - whale fishery , this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any . sometimes , nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated ; oftener the boat \\' s bow is knocked off , or the thigh - board , in which the headsman stands , is torn from its place and accompanies the body . but strangest of all is the circumstance , that in more instances than one , when the body has been recovered , not a single mark of violence is discernible ; the man being stark dead . the whole calamity , with the falling form of macey , was plainly descried from the ship . raising a piercing shriek --\" the vial ! the vial !\" gabriel called off the terror - stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale . this terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence ; because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically fore - announced it , instead of only making a general prophecy , which any one might have done , and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed . he became a nameless terror to the ship . mayhew having concluded his narration , ahab put such questions to him , that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the white whale , if opportunity should offer . to which ahab answered --\" aye .\" straightway , then , gabriel once more started to his feet , glaring upon the old man , and vehemently exclaimed , with downward pointed finger --\" think , think of the blasphemer -- dead , and down there !-- beware of the blasphemer \\' s end !\" ahab stolidly turned aside ; then said to mayhew , \" captain , i have just bethought me of my letter - bag ; there is a letter for one of thy officers , if i mistake not . starbuck , look over the bag .\" every whale - ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships , whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed , depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans . thus , most letters never reach their mark ; and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three years or more . soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand . it was sorely tumbled , damp , and covered with a dull , spotted , green mould , in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin . of such a letter , death himself might well have been the post - boy . \" can \\' st not read it ?\" cried ahab . \" give it me , man . aye , aye , it \\' s but a dim scrawl ;-- what \\' s this ?\" as he was studying it out , starbuck took a long cutting - spade pole , and with his knife slightly split the end , to insert the letter there , and in that way , hand it to the boat , without its coming any closer to the ship . meantime , ahab holding the letter , muttered , \" mr . har -- yes , mr . harry --( a woman \\' s pinny hand ,-- the man \\' s wife , i \\' ll wager )-- aye -- mr . harry macey , ship jeroboam ;-- why it \\' s macey , and he \\' s dead !\" \" poor fellow ! poor fellow ! and from his wife ,\" sighed mayhew ; \" but let me have it .\" \" nay , keep it thyself ,\" cried gabriel to ahab ; \" thou art soon going that way .\" \" curses throttle thee !\" yelled ahab . \" captain mayhew , stand by now to receive it \"; and taking the fatal missive from starbuck \\' s hands , he caught it in the slit of the pole , and reached it over towards the boat . but as he did so , the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing ; the boat drifted a little towards the ship \\' s stern ; so that , as if by magic , the letter suddenly ranged along with gabriel \\' s eager hand . he clutched it in an instant , seized the boat - knife , and impaling the letter on it , sent it thus loaded back into the ship . it fell at ahab \\' s feet . then gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars , and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the pequod . as , after this interlude , the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale , many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair . chapter 72 the monkey - rope . in the tumultuous business of cutting - in and attending to a whale , there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew . now hands are wanted here , and then again hands are wanted there . there is no staying in any one place ; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere . it is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene . we must now retrace our way a little . it was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale \\' s back , the blubber - hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates . but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole ? it was inserted there by my particular friend queequeg , whose duty it was , as harpooneer , to descend upon the monster \\' s back for the special purpose referred to . but in very many cases , circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded . the whale , be it observed , lies almost entirely submerged , excepting the immediate parts operated upon . so down there , some ten feet below the level of the deck , the poor harpooneer flounders about , half on the whale and half in the water , as the vast mass revolves like a tread - mill beneath him . on the occasion in question , queequeg figured in the highland costume -- a shirt and socks -- in which to my eyes , at least , he appeared to uncommon advantage ; and no one had a better chance to observe him , as will presently be seen . being the savage \\' s bowsman , that is , the person who pulled the bow - oar in his boat ( the second one from forward ), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard - scrabble scramble upon the dead whale \\' s back . you have seen italian organ - boys holding a dancing - ape by a long cord . just so , from the ship \\' s steep side , did i hold queequeg down there in the sea , by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey - rope , attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist . it was a humorously perilous business for both of us . for , before we proceed further , it must be said that the monkey - rope was fast at both ends ; fast to queequeg \\' s broad canvas belt , and fast to my narrow leather one . so that for better or for worse , we two , for the time , were wedded ; and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more , then both usage and honour demanded , that instead of cutting the cord , it should drag me down in his wake . so , then , an elongated siamese ligature united us . queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother ; nor could i any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed . so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then , that while earnestly watching his motions , i seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two ; that my free will had received a mortal wound ; and that another \\' s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death . therefore , i saw that here was a sort of interregnum in providence ; for its even - handed equity never could have so gross an injustice . and yet still further pondering -- while i jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship , which would threaten to jam him -- still further pondering , i say , i saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes ; only , in most cases , he , one way or other , has this siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals . if your banker breaks , you snap ; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills , you die . true , you may say that , by exceeding caution , you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life . but handle queequeg \\' s monkey - rope heedfully as i would , sometimes he jerked it so , that i came very near sliding overboard . nor could i possibly forget that , do what i would , i only had the management of one end of it .* * the monkey - rope is found in all whalers ; but it was only in the pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together . this improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than stubb , in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey - rope holder . i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the whale and the ship -- where he would occasionally fall , from the incessant rolling and swaying of both . but this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to . unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night , the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass -- the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive . and right in among those sharks was queequeg ; who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet . a thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale , the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man . nevertheless , it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie , it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them . accordingly , besides the monkey - rope , with which i now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark -- he was provided with still another protection . suspended over the side in one of the stages , tashtego and daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale - spades , wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach . this procedure of theirs , to be sure , was very disinterested and benevolent of them . they meant queequeg \\' s best happiness , i admit ; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him , and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood - muddled water , those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall . but poor queequeg , i suppose , straining and gasping there with that great iron hook -- poor queequeg , i suppose , only prayed to his yojo , and gave up his life into the hands of his gods . well , well , my dear comrade and twin - brother , thought i , as i drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea -- what matters it , after all ? are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world ? that unsounded ocean you gasp in , is life ; those sharks , your foes ; those spades , your friends ; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril , poor lad . but courage ! there is good cheer in store for you , queequeg . for now , as with blue lips and blood - shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side ; the steward advances , and with a benevolent , consolatory glance hands him -- what ? some hot cognac ? no ! hands him , ye gods ! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water ! \" ginger ? do i smell ginger ?\" suspiciously asked stubb , coming near . \" yes , this must be ginger ,\" peering into the as yet untasted cup . then standing as if incredulous for a while , he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying , \" ginger ? ginger ? and will you have the goodness to tell me , mr . dough - boy , where lies the virtue of ginger ? ginger ! is ginger the sort of fuel you use , dough - boy , to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal ? ginger !-- what the devil is ginger ?-- sea - coal ? firewood ?-- lucifer matches ?-- tinder ?-- gunpowder ?-- what the devil is ginger , i say , that you offer this cup to our poor queequeg here .\" \" there is some sneaking temperance society movement about this business ,\" he suddenly added , now approaching starbuck , who had just come from forward . \" will you look at that kannakin , sir ; smell of it , if you please .\" then watching the mate \\' s countenance , he added , \" the steward , mr . starbuck , had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to queequeg , there , this instant off the whale . is the steward an apothecary , sir ? and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half - drowned man ?\" \" i trust not ,\" said starbuck , \" it is poor stuff enough .\" \" aye , aye , steward ,\" cried stubb , \" we \\' ll teach you to drug it harpooneer ; none of your apothecary \\' s medicine here ; you want to poison us , do ye ? you have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all , and pocket the proceeds , do ye ?\" \" it was not me ,\" cried dough - boy , \" it was aunt charity that brought the ginger on board ; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits , but only this ginger - jub -- so she called it .\" \" ginger - jub ! you gingerly rascal ! take that ! and run along with ye to the lockers , and get something better . i hope i do no wrong , mr . starbuck . it is the captain \\' s orders -- grog for the harpooneer on a whale .\" \" enough ,\" replied starbuck , \" only don \\' t hit him again , but --\" \" oh , i never hurt when i hit , except when i hit a whale or something of that sort ; and this fellow \\' s a weazel . what were you about saying , sir ?\" \" only this : go down with him , and get what thou wantest thyself .\" when stubb reappeared , he came with a dark flask in one hand , and a sort of tea - caddy in the other . the first contained strong spirits , and was handed to queequeg ; the second was aunt charity \\' s gift , and that was freely given to the waves . chapter 73 stubb and flask kill a right whale ; and then have a talk over him . it must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whale \\' s prodigious head hanging to the pequod \\' s side . but we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it . for the present other matters press , and the best we can do now for the head , is to pray heaven the tackles may hold . now , during the past night and forenoon , the pequod had gradually drifted into a sea , which , by its occasional patches of yellow brit , gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales , a species of the leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near . and though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures ; and though the pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all , and though she had passed numbers of them near the crozetts without lowering a boat ; yet now that a sperm whale had been brought alongside and beheaded , to the surprise of all , the announcement was made that a right whale should be captured that day , if opportunity offered . nor was this long wanting . tall spouts were seen to leeward ; and two boats , stubb \\' s and flask \\' s , were detached in pursuit . pulling further and further away , they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast - head . but suddenly in the distance , they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water , and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast . an interval passed and the boats were in plain sight , in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale . so close did the monster come to the hull , that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice ; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom , within three rods of the planks , he wholly disappeared from view , as if diving under the keel . \" cut , cut !\" was the cry from the ship to the boats , which , for one instant , seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel \\' s side . but having plenty of line yet in the tubs , and the whale not sounding very rapidly , they paid out abundance of rope , and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship . for a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical ; for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction , and still plied their oars in another , the contending strain threatened to take them under . but it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain . and they stuck to it till they did gain it ; when instantly , a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel , as the strained line , scraping beneath the ship , suddenly rose to view under her bows , snapping and quivering ; and so flinging off its drippings , that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water , while the whale beyond also rose to sight , and once more the boats were free to fly . but the fagged whale abated his speed , and blindly altering his course , went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him , so that they performed a complete circuit . meantime , they hauled more and more upon their lines , till close flanking him on both sides , stubb answered flask with lance for lance ; and thus round and round the pequod the battle went , while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the sperm whale \\' s body , rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled , thirstily drinking at every new gash , as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock . at last his spout grew thick , and with a frightful roll and vomit , he turned upon his back a corpse . while the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes , and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing , some conversation ensued between them . \" i wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard ,\" said stubb , not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan . \" wants with it ?\" said flask , coiling some spare line in the boat \\' s bow , \" did you never hear that the ship which but once has a sperm whale \\' s head hoisted on her starboard side , and at the same time a right whale \\' s on the larboard ; did you never hear , stubb , that that ship can never afterwards capsize ?\" \" why not ? \" i don \\' t know , but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying so , and he seems to know all about ships \\' charms . but i sometimes think he \\' ll charm the ship to no good at last . i don \\' t half like that chap , stubb . did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake \\' s head , stubb ?\" \" sink him ! i never look at him at all ; but if ever i get a chance of a dark night , and he standing hard by the bulwarks , and no one by ; look down there , flask \"-- pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands --\" aye , will i ! flask , i take that fedallah to be the devil in disguise . do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship ? he \\' s the devil , i say . the reason why you don \\' t see his tail , is because he tucks it up out of sight ; he carries it coiled away in his pocket , i guess . blast him ! now that i think of it , he \\' s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots .\" \" he sleeps in his boots , don \\' t he ? he hasn \\' t got any hammock ; but i \\' ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging .\" \" no doubt , and it \\' s because of his cursed tail ; he coils it down , do ye see , in the eye of the rigging .\" \" what \\' s the old man have so much to do with him for ?\" \" striking up a swap or a bargain , i suppose .\" \" bargain ?-- about what ?\" \" why , do ye see , the old man is hard bent after that white whale , and the devil there is trying to come round him , and get him to swap away his silver watch , or his soul , or something of that sort , and then he \\' ll surrender moby dick .\" \" pooh ! stubb , you are skylarking ; how can fedallah do that ?\" \" i don \\' t know , flask , but the devil is a curious chap , and a wicked one , i tell ye . why , they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag - ship once , switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike , and inquiring if the old governor was at home . well , he was at home , and asked the devil what he wanted . the devil , switching his hoofs , up and says , \\' i want john .\\' \\' what for ?\\' says the old governor . \\' what business is that of yours ,\\' says the devil , getting mad ,--\\' i want to use him .\\' \\' take him ,\\' says the governor -- and by the lord , flask , if the devil didn \\' t give john the asiatic cholera before he got through with him , i \\' ll eat this whale in one mouthful . but look sharp -- ain \\' t you all ready there ? well , then , pull ahead , and let \\' s get the whale alongside .\" \" i think i remember some such story as you were telling ,\" said flask , when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship , \" but i can \\' t remember where .\" \" three spaniards ? adventures of those three bloody - minded soladoes ? did ye read it there , flask ? i guess ye did ?\" \" no : never saw such a book ; heard of it , though . but now , tell me , stubb , do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now , was the same you say is now on board the pequod ?\" \" am i the same man that helped kill this whale ? doesn \\' t the devil live for ever ; who ever heard that the devil was dead ? did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil ? and if the devil has a latch - key to get into the admiral \\' s cabin , don \\' t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole ? tell me that , mr . flask ?\" \" how old do you suppose fedallah is , stubb ?\" \" do you see that mainmast there ?\" pointing to the ship ; \" well , that \\' s the figure one ; now take all the hoops in the pequod \\' s hold , and string along in a row with that mast , for oughts , do you see ; well , that wouldn \\' t begin to be fedallah \\' s age . nor all the coopers in creation couldn \\' t show hoops enough to make oughts enough .\" \" but see here , stubb , i thought you a little boasted just now , that you meant to give fedallah a sea - toss , if you got a good chance . now , if he \\' s so old as all those hoops of yours come to , and if he is going to live for ever , what good will it do to pitch him overboard -- tell me that ? \" give him a good ducking , anyhow .\" \" but he \\' d crawl back .\" \" duck him again ; and keep ducking him .\" \" suppose he should take it into his head to duck you , though -- yes , and drown you -- what then ?\" \" i should like to see him try it ; i \\' d give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn \\' t dare to show his face in the admiral \\' s cabin again for a long while , let alone down in the orlop there , where he lives , and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much . damn the devil , flask ; so you suppose i \\' m afraid of the devil ? who \\' s afraid of him , except the old governor who daresn \\' t catch him and put him in double - darbies , as he deserves , but lets him go about kidnapping people ; aye , and signed a bond with him , that all the people the devil kidnapped , he \\' d roast for him ? there \\' s a governor !\" \" do you suppose fedallah wants to kidnap captain ahab ?\" \" do i suppose it ? you \\' ll know it before long , flask . but i am going now to keep a sharp look - out on him ; and if i see anything very suspicious going on , i \\' ll just take him by the nape of his neck , and say -- look here , beelzebub , you don \\' t do it ; and if he makes any fuss , by the lord i \\' ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail , take it to the capstan , and give him such a wrenching and heaving , that his tail will come short off at the stump -- do you see ; and then , i rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion , he \\' ll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs .\" \" and what will you do with the tail , stubb ?\" \" do with it ? sell it for an ox whip when we get home ;-- what else ?\" \" now , do you mean what you say , and have been saying all along , stubb ?\" \" mean or not mean , here we are at the ship .\" the boats were here hailed , to tow the whale on the larboard side , where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him . \" didn \\' t i tell you so ?\" said flask ; \" yes , you \\' ll soon see this right whale \\' s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti \\' s .\" in good time , flask \\' s saying proved true . as before , the pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale \\' s head , now , by the counterpoise of both heads , she regained her even keel ; though sorely strained , you may well believe . so , when on one side you hoist in locke \\' s head , you go over that way ; but now , on the other side , hoist in kant \\' s and you come back again ; but in very poor plight . thus , some minds for ever keep trimming boat . oh , ye foolish ! throw all these thunder - heads overboard , and then you will float light and right . in disposing of the body of a right whale , when brought alongside the ship , the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale ; only , in the latter instance , the head is cut off whole , but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck , with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown - piece . but nothing like this , in the present case , had been done . the carcases of both whales had dropped astern ; and the head - laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers . meantime , fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale \\' s head , and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand . and ahab chanced so to stand , that the parsee occupied his shadow ; while , if the parsee \\' s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with , and lengthen ahab \\' s . as the crew toiled on , laplandish speculations were bandied among them , concerning all these passing things . chapter 74 the sperm whale \\' s head -- contrasted view . here , now , are two great whales , laying their heads together ; let us join them , and lay together our own . of the grand order of folio leviathans , the sperm whale and the right whale are by far the most noteworthy . they are the only whales regularly hunted by man . to the nantucketer , they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale . as the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads ; and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the pequod \\' s side ; and as we may freely go from one to the other , by merely stepping across the deck :-- where , i should like to know , will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here ? in the first place , you are struck by the general contrast between these heads . both are massive enough in all conscience ; but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale \\' s which the right whale \\' s sadly lacks . there is more character in the sperm whale \\' s head . as you behold it , you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him , in point of pervading dignity . in the present instance , too , this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit , giving token of advanced age and large experience . in short , he is what the fishermen technically call a \" grey - headed whale .\" let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads -- namely , the two most important organs , the eye and the ear . far back on the side of the head , and low down , near the angle of either whale \\' s jaw , if you narrowly search , you will at last see a lashless eye , which you would fancy to be a young colt \\' s eye ; so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head . now , from this peculiar sideway position of the whale \\' s eyes , it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead , no more than he can one exactly astern . in a word , the position of the whale \\' s eyes corresponds to that of a man \\' s ears ; and you may fancy , for yourself , how it would fare with you , did you sideways survey objects through your ears . you would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side - line of sight ; and about thirty more behind it . if your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you , with dagger uplifted in broad day , you would not be able to see him , any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind . in a word , you would have two backs , so to speak ; but , at the same time , also , two fronts ( side fronts ): for what is it that makes the front of a man -- what , indeed , but his eyes ? moreover , while in most other animals that i can now think of , the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power , so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain ; the peculiar position of the whale \\' s eyes , effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head , which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys ; this , of course , must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts . the whale , therefore , must see one distinct picture on this side , and another distinct picture on that side ; while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him . man may , in effect , be said to look out on the world from a sentry - box with two joined sashes for his window . but with the whale , these two sashes are separately inserted , making two distinct windows , but sadly impairing the view . this peculiarity of the whale \\' s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery ; and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes . a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the leviathan . but i must be content with a hint . so long as a man \\' s eyes are open in the light , the act of seeing is involuntary ; that is , he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him . nevertheless , any one \\' s experience will teach him , that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance , it is quite impossible for him , attentively , and completely , to examine any two things -- however large or however small -- at one and the same instant of time ; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other . but if you now come to separate these two objects , and surround each by a circle of profound darkness ; then , in order to see one of them , in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it , the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness . how is it , then , with the whale ? true , both his eyes , in themselves , must simultaneously act ; but is his brain so much more comprehensive , combining , and subtle than man \\' s , that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects , one on one side of him , and the other in an exactly opposite direction ? if he can , then is it as marvellous a thing in him , as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in euclid . nor , strictly investigated , is there any incongruity in this comparison . it may be but an idle whim , but it has always seemed to me , that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats ; the timidity and liability to queer frights , so common to such whales ; i think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition , in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them . but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye . if you are an entire stranger to their race , you might hunt over these two heads for hours , and never discover that organ . the ear has no external leaf whatever ; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill , so wondrously minute is it . it is lodged a little behind the eye . with respect to their ears , this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right . while the ear of the former has an external opening , that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane , so as to be quite imperceptible from without . is it not curious , that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye , and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare \\' s ? but if his eyes were broad as the lens of herschel \\' s great telescope ; and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals ; would that make him any longer of sight , or sharper of hearing ? not at all .-- why then do you try to \" enlarge \" your mind ? subtilize it . let us now with whatever levers and steam - engines we have at hand , cant over the sperm whale \\' s head , that it may lie bottom up ; then , ascending by a ladder to the summit , have a peep down the mouth ; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it , with a lantern we might descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach . but let us hold on here by this tooth , and look about us where we are . what a really beautiful and chaste - looking mouth ! from floor to ceiling , lined , or rather papered with a glistening white membrane , glossy as bridal satins . but come out now , and look at this portentous lower jaw , which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff - box , with the hinge at one end , instead of one side . if you pry it up , so as to get it overhead , and expose its rows of teeth , it seems a terrific portcullis ; and such , alas ! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery , upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force . but far more terrible is it to behold , when fathoms down in the sea , you see some sulky whale , floating there suspended , with his prodigious jaw , some fifteen feet long , hanging straight down at right - angles with his body , for all the world like a ship \\' s jib - boom . this whale is not dead ; he is only dispirited ; out of sorts , perhaps ; hypochondriac ; and so supine , that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed , leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight , a reproach to all his tribe , who must , no doubt , imprecate lock - jaws upon him . in most cases this lower jaw -- being easily unhinged by a practised artist -- is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth , and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles , including canes , umbrella - stocks , and handles to riding - whips . with a long , weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board , as if it were an anchor ; and when the proper time comes -- some few days after the other work -- queequeg , daggoo , and tashtego , being all accomplished dentists , are set to drawing teeth . with a keen cutting - spade , queequeg lances the gums ; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts , and a tackle being rigged from aloft , they drag out these teeth , as michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands . there are generally forty - two teeth in all ; in old whales , much worn down , but undecayed ; nor filled after our artificial fashion . the jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs , and piled away like joists for building houses . chapter 75 the right whale \\' s head -- contrasted view . crossing the deck , let us now have a good long look at the right whale \\' s head . as in general shape the noble sperm whale \\' s head may be compared to a roman war - chariot ( especially in front , where it is so broadly rounded ); so , at a broad view , the right whale \\' s head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot - toed shoe . two hundred years ago an old dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker \\' s last . and in this same last or shoe , that old woman of the nursery tale , with the swarming brood , might very comfortably be lodged , she and all her progeny . but as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects , according to your point of view . if you stand on its summit and look at these two f - shaped spoutholes , you would take the whole head for an enormous bass - viol , and these spiracles , the apertures in its sounding - board . then , again , if you fix your eye upon this strange , crested , comb - like incrustation on the top of the mass -- this green , barnacled thing , which the greenlanders call the \" crown ,\" and the southern fishers the \" bonnet \" of the right whale ; fixing your eyes solely on this , you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak , with a bird \\' s nest in its crotch . at any rate , when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet , such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you ; unless , indeed , your fancy has been fixed by the technical term \" crown \" also bestowed upon it ; in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea , whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner . but if this whale be a king , he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem . look at that hanging lower lip ! what a huge sulk and pout is there ! a sulk and pout , by carpenter \\' s measurement , about twenty feet long and five feet deep ; a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more . a great pity , now , that this unfortunate whale should be hare - lipped . the fissure is about a foot across . probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down the peruvian coast , when earthquakes caused the beach to gape . over this lip , as over a slippery threshold , we now slide into the mouth . upon my word were i at mackinaw , i should take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam . good lord ! is this the road that jonah went ? the roof is about twelve feet high , and runs to a pretty sharp angle , as if there were a regular ridge - pole there ; while these ribbed , arched , hairy sides , present us with those wondrous , half vertical , scimetar - shaped slats of whalebone , say three hundred on a side , which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone , form those venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned . the edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres , through which the right whale strains the water , and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish , when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time . in the central blinds of bone , as they stand in their natural order , there are certain curious marks , curves , hollows , and ridges , whereby some whalemen calculate the creature \\' s age , as the age of an oak by its circular rings . though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable , yet it has the savor of analogical probability . at any rate , if we yield to it , we must grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable . in old times , there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning these blinds . one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrous \" whiskers \" inside of the whale \\' s mouth ;* another , \" hogs \\' bristles \"; a third old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant language : \" there are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper chop , which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth .\" * this reminds us that the right whale really has a sort of whisker , or rather a moustache , consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw . sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance . as every one knows , these same \" hogs \\' bristles ,\" \" fins ,\" \" whiskers ,\" \" blinds ,\" or whatever you please , furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances . but in this particular , the demand has long been on the decline . it was in queen anne \\' s time that the bone was in its glory , the farthingale being then all the fashion . and as those ancient dames moved about gaily , though in the jaws of the whale , as you may say ; even so , in a shower , with the like thoughtlessness , do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection ; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone . but now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment , and , standing in the right whale \\' s mouth , look around you afresh . seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about , would you not think you were inside of the great haarlem organ , and gazing upon its thousand pipes ? for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest turkey -- the tongue , which is glued , as it were , to the floor of the mouth . it is very fat and tender , and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck . this particular tongue now before us ; at a passing glance i should say it was a six - barreler ; that is , it will yield you about that amount of oil . ere this , you must have plainly seen the truth of what i started with -- that the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely different heads . to sum up , then : in the right whale \\' s there is no great well of sperm ; no ivory teeth at all ; no long , slender mandible of a lower jaw , like the sperm whale \\' s . nor in the sperm whale are there any of those blinds of bone ; no huge lower lip ; and scarcely anything of a tongue . again , the right whale has two external spout - holes , the sperm whale only one . look your last , now , on these venerable hooded heads , while they yet lie together ; for one will soon sink , unrecorded , in the sea ; the other will not be very long in following . can you catch the expression of the sperm whale \\' s there ? it is the same he died with , only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away . i think his broad brow to be full of a prairie - like placidity , born of a speculative indifference as to death . but mark the other head \\' s expression . see that amazing lower lip , pressed by accident against the vessel \\' s side , so as firmly to embrace the jaw . does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death ? this right whale i take to have been a stoic ; the sperm whale , a platonian , who might have taken up spinoza in his latter years . chapter 76 the battering - ram . ere quitting , for the nonce , the sperm whale \\' s head , i would have you , as a sensible physiologist , simply -- particularly remark its front aspect , in all its compacted collectedness . i would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated , intelligent estimate of whatever battering - ram power may be lodged there . here is a vital point ; for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself , or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling , but not the less true events , perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history . you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale , the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water ; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards , so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom - like lower jaw ; you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head , much in the same way , indeed , as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin . moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose ; and that what nose he has -- his spout hole -- is on the top of his head ; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head , nearly one third of his entire length from the front . wherefore , you must now have perceived that the front of the sperm whale \\' s head is a dead , blind wall , without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever . furthermore , you are now to consider that only in the extreme , lower , backward sloping part of the front of the head , is there the slightest vestige of bone ; and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development . so that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad . finally , though , as will soon be revealed , its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil ; yet , you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy . in some previous place i have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale , as the rind wraps an orange . just so with the head ; but with this difference : about the head this envelope , though not so thick , is of a boneless toughness , inestimable by any man who has not handled it . the severest pointed harpoon , the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm , impotently rebounds from it . it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were paved with horses \\' hoofs . i do not think that any sensation lurks in it . bethink yourself also of another thing . when two large , loaded indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks , what do the sailors do ? they do not suspend between them , at the point of coming contact , any merely hard substance , like iron or wood . no , they hold there a large , round wad of tow and cork , enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox - hide . that bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow - bars . by itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at . but supplementary to this , it has hypothetically occurred to me , that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them , capable , at will , of distension or contraction ; and as the sperm whale , as far as i know , has no such provision in him ; considering , too , the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface , and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water ; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope ; considering the unique interior of his head ; it has hypothetically occurred to me , i say , that those mystical lung - celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air , so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction . if this be so , fancy the irresistibleness of that might , to which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes . now , mark . unerringly impelling this dead , impregnable , uninjurable wall , and this most buoyant thing within ; there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life , only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is -- by the cord ; and all obedient to one volition , as the smallest insect . so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster ; when i shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats ; i trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity , and be ready to abide by this ; that though the sperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien , and mixed the atlantic with the pacific , you would not elevate one hair of your eye - brow . for unless you own the whale , you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in truth . but clear truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter ; how small the chances for the provincials then ? what befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess \\' s veil at lais ? chapter 77 the great heidelburgh tun . now comes the baling of the case . but to comprehend it aright , you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon . regarding the sperm whale \\' s head as a solid oblong , you may , on an inclined plane , sideways divide it into two quoins ,* whereof the lower is the bony structure , forming the cranium and jaws , and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones ; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale . at the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin , and then you have two almost equal parts , which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance . * quoin is not a euclidean term . it belongs to the pure nautical mathematics . i know not that it has been defined before . a quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side , instead of the mutual tapering of both sides . the lower subdivided part , called the junk , is one immense honeycomb of oil , formed by the crossing and recrossing , into ten thousand infiltrated cells , of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent . the upper part , known as the case , may be regarded as the great heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale . and as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front , so the whale \\' s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun . moreover , as that of heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys , so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages ; namely , the highly - prized spermaceti , in its absolutely pure , limpid , and odoriferous state . nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature . though in life it remains perfectly fluid , yet , upon exposure to the air , after death , it soon begins to concrete ; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots , as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water . a large whale \\' s case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm , though from unavoidable circumstances , considerable of it is spilled , leaks , and dribbles away , or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can . i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun was coated within , but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl - coloured membrane , like the lining of a fine pelisse , forming the inner surface of the sperm whale \\' s case . it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head ; and since -- as has been elsewhere set forth -- the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature , then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale , you have more than twenty - six feet for the depth of the tun , when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship \\' s side . as in decapitating the whale , the operator \\' s instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine ; he has , therefore , to be uncommonly heedful , lest a careless , untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents . it is this decapitated end of the head , also , which is at last elevated out of the water , and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles , whose hempen combinations , on one side , make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter . thus much being said , attend now , i pray you , to that marvellous and -- in this particular instance -- almost fatal operation whereby the sperm whale \\' s great heidelburgh tun is tapped . chapter 78 cistern and buckets . nimble as a cat , tashtego mounts aloft ; and without altering his erect posture , runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard - arm , to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted tun . he has carried with him a light tackle called a whip , consisting of only two parts , travelling through a single - sheaved block . securing this block , so that it hangs down from the yard - arm , he swings one end of the rope , till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck . then , hand - over - hand , down the other part , the indian drops through the air , till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head . there -- still high elevated above the rest of the company , to whom he vivaciously cries -- he seems some turkish muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower . a short - handled sharp spade being sent up to him , he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the tun . in this business he proceeds very heedfully , like a treasure - hunter in some old house , sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in . by the time this cautious search is over , a stout iron - bound bucket , precisely like a well - bucket , has been attached to one end of the whip ; while the other end , being stretched across the deck , is there held by two or three alert hands . these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the indian , to whom another person has reached up a very long pole . inserting this pole into the bucket , tashtego downward guides the bucket into the tun , till it entirely disappears ; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip , up comes the bucket again , all bubbling like a dairy - maid \\' s pail of new milk . carefully lowered from its height , the full - freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand , and quickly emptied into a large tub . then remounting aloft , it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more . towards the end , tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder , and deeper and deeper into the tun , until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down . now , the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way ; several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm ; when all at once a queer accident happened . whether it was that tashtego , that wild indian , was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one - handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head ; or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy ; or whether the evil one himself would have it to fall out so , without stating his particular reasons ; how it was exactly , there is no telling now ; but , on a sudden , as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up -- my god ! poor tashtego -- like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well , dropped head - foremost down into this great tun of heidelburgh , and with a horrible oily gurgling , went clean out of sight ! \" man overboard !\" cried daggoo , who amid the general consternation first came to his senses . \" swing the bucket this way !\" and putting one foot into it , so as the better to secure his slippery hand - hold on the whip itself , the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head , almost before tashtego could have reached its interior bottom . meantime , there was a terrible tumult . looking over the side , they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea , as if that moment seized with some momentous idea ; whereas it was only the poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk . at this instant , while daggoo , on the summit of the head , was clearing the whip -- which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles -- a sharp cracking noise was heard ; and to the unspeakable horror of all , one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out , and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung , till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg . the one remaining hook , upon which the entire strain now depended , seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way ; an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head . \" come down , come down !\" yelled the seamen to daggoo , but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles , so that if the head should drop , he would still remain suspended ; the negro having cleared the foul line , rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well , meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it , and so be hoisted out . \" in heaven \\' s name , man ,\" cried stubb , \" are you ramming home a cartridge there ?-- avast ! how will that help him ; jamming that iron - bound bucket on top of his head ? avast , will ye !\" \" stand clear of the tackle !\" cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket . almost in the same instant , with a thunder - boom , the enormous mass dropped into the sea , like niagara \\' s table - rock into the whirlpool ; the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it , to far down her glittering copper ; and all caught their breath , as half swinging -- now over the sailors \\' heads , and now over the water -- daggoo , through a thick mist of spray , was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles , while poor , buried - alive tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea ! but hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away , when a naked figure with a boarding - sword in his hand , was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks . the next , a loud splash announced that my brave queequeg had dived to the rescue . one packed rush was made to the side , and every eye counted every ripple , as moment followed moment , and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen . some hands now jumped into a boat alongside , and pushed a little off from the ship . \" ha ! ha !\" cried daggoo , all at once , from his now quiet , swinging perch overhead ; and looking further off from the side , we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves ; a sight strange to see , as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave . \" both ! both !-- it is both !\"-- cried daggoo again with a joyful shout ; and soon after , queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand , and with the other clutching the long hair of the indian . drawn into the waiting boat , they were quickly brought to the deck ; but tashtego was long in coming to , and queequeg did not look very brisk . now , how had this noble rescue been accomplished ? why , diving after the slowly descending head , queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom , so as to scuttle a large hole there ; then dropping his sword , had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards , and so hauled out poor tash by the head . he averred , that upon first thrusting in for him , a leg was presented ; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be , and might occasion great trouble ;-- he had thrust back the leg , and by a dexterous heave and toss , had wrought a somerset upon the indian ; so that with the next trial , he came forth in the good old way -- head foremost . as for the great head itself , that was doing as well as could be expected . and thus , through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of queequeg , the deliverance , or rather , delivery of tashtego , was successfully accomplished , in the teeth , too , of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments ; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten . midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing , riding and rowing . i know that this queer adventure of the gay - header \\' s will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen , though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one \\' s falling into a cistern ashore ; an accident which not seldom happens , and with much less reason too than the indian \\' s , considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the sperm whale \\' s well . but , peradventure , it may be sagaciously urged , how is this ? we thought the tissued , infiltrated head of the sperm whale , was the lightest and most corky part about him ; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself . we have thee there . not at all , but i have ye ; for at the time poor tash fell in , the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents , leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well -- a double welded , hammered substance , as i have before said , much heavier than the sea water , and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost . but the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it , so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed , affording queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run , as you may say . yes , it was a running delivery , so it was . now , had tashtego perished in that head , it had been a very precious perishing ; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti ; coffined , hearsed , and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale . only one sweeter end can readily be recalled -- the delicious death of an ohio honey - hunter , who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree , found such exceeding store of it , that leaning too far over , it sucked him in , so that he died embalmed . how many , think ye , have likewise fallen into plato \\' s honey head , and sweetly perished there ? chapter 79 the prairie . to scan the lines of his face , or feel the bumps on the head of this leviathan ; this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist has as yet undertaken . such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the rock of gibraltar , or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of the pantheon . still , in that famous work of his , lavater not only treats of the various faces of men , but also attentively studies the faces of horses , birds , serpents , and fish ; and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein . nor have gall and his disciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man . therefore , though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer , in the application of these two semi - sciences to the whale , i will do my endeavor . i try all things ; i achieve what i can . physiognomically regarded , the sperm whale is an anomalous creature . he has no proper nose . and since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features ; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression ; hence it would seem that its entire absence , as an external appendage , must very largely affect the countenance of the whale . for as in landscape gardening , a spire , cupola , monument , or tower of some sort , is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene ; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open - work belfry of the nose . dash the nose from phidias \\' s marble jove , and what a sorry remainder ! nevertheless , leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude , all his proportions are so stately , that the same deficiency which in the sculptured jove were hideous , in him is no blemish at all . nay , it is an added grandeur . a nose to the whale would have been impertinent . as on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly - boat , your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled . a pestilent conceit , which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne . in some particulars , perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the sperm whale , is that of the full front of his head . this aspect is sublime . in thought , a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with the morning . in the repose of the pasture , the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it . pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles , the elephant \\' s brow is majestic . human or animal , the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the german emperors to their decrees . it signifies --\" god : done this day by my hand .\" but in most creatures , nay in man himself , very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line . few are the foreheads which like shakespeare \\' s or melancthon \\' s rise so high , and descend so low , that the eyes themselves seem clear , eternal , tideless mountain lakes ; and all above them in the forehead \\' s wrinkles , you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink , as the highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer . but in the great sperm whale , this high and mighty god - like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified , that gazing on it , in that full front view , you feel the deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature . for you see no one point precisely ; not one distinct feature is revealed ; no nose , eyes , ears , or mouth ; no face ; he has none , proper ; nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead , pleated with riddles ; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats , and ships , and men . nor , in profile , does this wondrous brow diminish ; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so . in profile , you plainly perceive that horizontal , semi - crescentic depression in the forehead \\' s middle , which , in man , is lavater \\' s mark of genius . but how ? genius in the sperm whale ? has the sperm whale ever written a book , spoken a speech ? no , his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it . it is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence . and this reminds me that had the great sperm whale been known to the young orient world , he would have been deified by their child - magian thoughts . they deified the crocodile of the nile , because the crocodile is tongueless ; and the sperm whale has no tongue , or at least it is so exceedingly small , as to be incapable of protrusion . if hereafter any highly cultured , poetical nation shall lure back to their birth - right , the merry may - day gods of old ; and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky ; in the now unhaunted hill ; then be sure , exalted to jove \\' s high seat , the great sperm whale shall lord it . champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics . but there is no champollion to decipher the egypt of every man \\' s and every being \\' s face . physiognomy , like every other human science , is but a passing fable . if then , sir william jones , who read in thirty languages , could not read the simplest peasant \\' s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings , how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee of the sperm whale \\' s brow ? i but put that brow before you . read it if you can . chapter 80 the nut . if the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx , to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square . in the full - grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length . unhinge the lower jaw , and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base . but in life -- as we have elsewhere seen -- this inclined plane is angularly filled up , and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm . at the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass ; while under the long floor of this crater -- in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth -- reposes the mere handful of this monster \\' s brain . the brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life ; it is hidden away behind its vast outworks , like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of quebec . so like a choice casket is it secreted in him , that i have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic - yards of his sperm magazine . lying in strange folds , courses , and convolutions , to their apprehensions , it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence . it is plain , then , that phrenologically the head of this leviathan , in the creature \\' s living intact state , is an entire delusion . as for his true brain , you can then see no indications of it , nor feel any . the whale , like all things that are mighty , wears a false brow to the common world . if you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end , which is the high end , you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull , beheld in the same situation , and from the same point of view . indeed , place this reversed skull ( scaled down to the human magnitude ) among a plate of men \\' s skulls , and you would involuntarily confound it with them ; and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit , in phrenological phrase you would say -- this man had no self - esteem , and no veneration . and by those negations , considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power , you can best form to yourself the truest , though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is . but if from the comparative dimensions of the whale \\' s proper brain , you deem it incapable of being adequately charted , then i have another idea for you . if you attentively regard almost any quadruped \\' s spine , you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls , all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper . it is a german conceit , that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls . but the curious external resemblance , i take it the germans were not the first men to perceive . a foreign friend once pointed it out to me , in the skeleton of a foe he had slain , and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying , in a sort of basso - relievo , the beaked prow of his canoe . now , i consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal . for i believe that much of a man \\' s character will be found betokened in his backbone . i would rather feel your spine than your skull , whoever you are . a thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul . i rejoice in my spine , as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which i fling half out to the world . apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale . his cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck - vertebra ; and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across , being eight in height , and of a triangular figure with the base downwards . as it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size , but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity . now , of course , this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance -- the spinal cord -- as the brain ; and directly communicates with the brain . and what is still more , for many feet after emerging from the brain \\' s cavity , the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth , almost equal to that of the brain . under all these circumstances , would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale \\' s spine phrenologically ? for , viewed in this light , the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord . but leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists , i would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment , in reference to the sperm whale \\' s hump . this august hump , if i mistake not , rises over one of the larger vertebrae , and is , therefore , in some sort , the outer convex mould of it . from its relative situation then , i should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the sperm whale . and that the great monster is indomitable , you will yet have reason to know . chapter 81 the pequod meets the virgin . the predestinated day arrived , and we duly met the ship jungfrau , derick de deer , master , of bremen . at one time the greatest whaling people in the world , the dutch and germans are now among the least ; but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude , you still occasionally meet with their flag in the pacific . for some reason , the jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects . while yet some distance from the pequod , she rounded to , and dropping a boat , her captain was impelled towards us , impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern . \" what has he in his hand there ?\" cried starbuck , pointing to something wavingly held by the german . \" impossible !-- a lamp - feeder !\" \" not that ,\" said stubb , \" no , no , it \\' s a coffee - pot , mr . starbuck ; he \\' s coming off to make us our coffee , is the yarman ; don \\' t you see that big tin can there alongside of him ?-- that \\' s his boiling water . oh ! he \\' s all right , is the yarman .\" \" go along with you ,\" cried flask , \" it \\' s a lamp - feeder and an oil - can . he \\' s out of oil , and has come a - begging .\" however curious it may seem for an oil - ship to be borrowing oil on the whale - ground , and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to newcastle , yet sometimes such a thing really happens ; and in the present case captain derick de deer did indubitably conduct a lamp - feeder as flask did declare . as he mounted the deck , ahab abruptly accosted him , without at all heeding what he had in his hand ; but in his broken lingo , the german soon evinced his complete ignorance of the white whale ; immediately turning the conversation to his lamp - feeder and oil can , with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness -- his last drop of bremen oil being gone , and not a single flying - fish yet captured to supply the deficiency ; concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the fishery is technically called a clean one ( that is , an empty one ), well deserving the name of jungfrau or the virgin . his necessities supplied , derick departed ; but he had not gained his ship \\' s side , when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast - heads of both vessels ; and so eager for the chase was derick , that without pausing to put his oil - can and lamp - feeder aboard , he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp - feeders . now , the game having risen to leeward , he and the other three german boats that soon followed him , had considerably the start of the pequod \\' s keels . there were eight whales , an average pod . aware of their danger , they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind , rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness . they left a great , wide wake , as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea . full in this rapid wake , and many fathoms in the rear , swam a huge , humped old bull , which by his comparatively slow progress , as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him , seemed afflicted with the jaundice , or some other infirmity . whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance , seemed questionable ; for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social . nevertheless , he stuck to their wake , though indeed their back water must have retarded him , because the white - bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one , like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet . his spout was short , slow , and laborious ; coming forth with a choking sort of gush , and spending itself in torn shreds , followed by strange subterranean commotions in him , which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity , causing the waters behind him to upbubble . \" who \\' s got some paregoric ?\" said stubb , \" he has the stomach - ache , i \\' m afraid . lord , think of having half an acre of stomach - ache ! adverse winds are holding mad christmas in him , boys . it \\' s the first foul wind i ever knew to blow from astern ; but look , did ever whale yaw so before ? it must be , he \\' s lost his tiller .\" as an overladen indiaman bearing down the hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses , careens , buries , rolls , and wallows on her way ; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk , and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous rib - ends , expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin . whether he had lost that fin in battle , or had been born without it , it were hard to say . \" only wait a bit , old chap , and i \\' ll give ye a sling for that wounded arm ,\" cried cruel flask , pointing to the whale - line near him . \" mind he don \\' t sling thee with it ,\" cried starbuck . \" give way , or the german will have him .\" with one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish , because not only was he the largest , and therefore the most valuable whale , but he was nearest to them , and the other whales were going with such great velocity , moreover , as almost to defy pursuit for the time . at this juncture the pequod \\' s keels had shot by the three german boats last lowered ; but from the great start he had had , derick \\' s boat still led the chase , though every moment neared by his foreign rivals . the only thing they feared , was , that from being already so nigh to his mark , he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him . as for derick , he seemed quite confident that this would be the case , and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp - feeder at the other boats . \" the ungracious and ungrateful dog !\" cried starbuck ; \" he mocks and dares me with the very poor - box i filled for him not five minutes ago !\"-- then in his old intense whisper --\" give way , greyhounds ! dog to it !\" \" i tell ye what it is , men \"-- cried stubb to his crew --\" it \\' s against my religion to get mad ; but i \\' d like to eat that villainous yarman -- pull -- won \\' t ye ? are ye going to let that rascal beat ye ? do ye love brandy ? a hogshead of brandy , then , to the best man . come , why don \\' t some of ye burst a blood - vessel ? who \\' s that been dropping an anchor overboard -- we don \\' t budge an inch -- we \\' re becalmed . halloo , here \\' s grass growing in the boat \\' s bottom -- and by the lord , the mast there \\' s budding . this won \\' t do , boys . look at that yarman ! the short and long of it is , men , will ye spit fire or not ?\" \" oh ! see the suds he makes !\" cried flask , dancing up and down --\" what a hump -- oh , do pile on the beef -- lays like a log ! oh ! my lads , do spring -- slap - jacks and quahogs for supper , you know , my lads -- baked clams and muffins -- oh , do , do , spring ,-- he \\' s a hundred barreller -- don \\' t lose him now -- don \\' t oh , don \\' t !-- see that yarman -- oh , won \\' t ye pull for your duff , my lads -- such a sog ! such a sogger ! don \\' t ye love sperm ? there goes three thousand dollars , men !-- a bank !-- a whole bank ! the bank of england !-- oh , do , do , do !-- what \\' s that yarman about now ?\" at this moment derick was in the act of pitching his lamp - feeder at the advancing boats , and also his oil - can ; perhaps with the double view of retarding his rivals \\' way , and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss . \" the unmannerly dutch dogger !\" cried stubb . \" pull now , men , like fifty thousand line - of - battle - ship loads of red - haired devils . what d \\' ye say , tashtego ; are you the man to snap your spine in two - and - twenty pieces for the honour of old gayhead ? what d \\' ye say ?\" \" i say , pull like god - dam ,\"-- cried the indian . fiercely , but evenly incited by the taunts of the german , the pequod \\' s three boats now began ranging almost abreast ; and , so disposed , momentarily neared him . in that fine , loose , chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey , the three mates stood up proudly , occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of , \" there she slides , now ! hurrah for the white - ash breeze ! down with the yarman ! sail over him !\" but so decided an original start had derick had , that spite of all their gallantry , he would have proved the victor in this race , had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman . while this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white - ash , and while , in consequence , derick \\' s boat was nigh to capsizing , and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage ;-- that was a good time for starbuck , stubb , and flask . with a shout , they took a mortal start forwards , and slantingly ranged up on the german \\' s quarter . an instant more , and all four boats were diagonically in the whale \\' s immediate wake , while stretching from them , on both sides , was the foaming swell that he made . it was a terrific , most pitiable , and maddening sight . the whale was now going head out , and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet ; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright . now to this hand , now to that , he yawed in his faltering flight , and still at every billow that he broke , he spasmodically sank in the sea , or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin . so have i seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air , vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks . but the bird has a voice , and with plaintive cries will make known her fear ; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea , was chained up and enchanted in him ; he had no voice , save that choking respiration through his spiracle , and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable ; while still , in his amazing bulk , portcullis jaw , and omnipotent tail , there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied . seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the pequod \\' s boats the advantage , and rather than be thus foiled of his game , derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart , ere the last chance would for ever escape . but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke , than all three tigers -- queequeg , tashtego , daggoo -- instinctively sprang to their feet , and standing in a diagonal row , simultaneously pointed their barbs ; and darted over the head of the german harpooneer , their three nantucket irons entered the whale . blinding vapours of foam and white - fire ! the three boats , in the first fury of the whale \\' s headlong rush , bumped the german \\' s aside with such force , that both derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out , and sailed over by the three flying keels . \" don \\' t be afraid , my butter - boxes ,\" cried stubb , casting a passing glance upon them as he shot by ; \" ye \\' ll be picked up presently -- all right -- i saw some sharks astern -- st . bernard \\' s dogs , you know -- relieve distressed travellers . hurrah ! this is the way to sail now . every keel a sunbeam ! hurrah !-- here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar ! this puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain -- makes the wheel - spokes fly , boys , when you fasten to him that way ; and there \\' s danger of being pitched out too , when you strike a hill . hurrah ! this is the way a fellow feels when he \\' s going to davy jones -- all a rush down an endless inclined plane ! hurrah ! this whale carries the everlasting mail !\" but the monster \\' s run was a brief one . giving a sudden gasp , he tumultuously sounded . with a grating rush , the three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them ; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines , that using all their dexterous might , they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on ; till at last -- owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead - lined chocks of the boats , whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue -- the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water , while the three sterns tilted high in the air . and the whale soon ceasing to sound , for some time they remained in that attitude , fearful of expending more line , though the position was a little ticklish . but though boats have been taken down and lost in this way , yet it is this \" holding on ,\" as it is called ; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back ; this it is that often torments the leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes . yet not to speak of the peril of the thing , it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best ; for it is but reasonable to presume , that the longer the stricken whale stays under water , the more he is exhausted . because , owing to the enormous surface of him -- in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet -- the pressure of the water is immense . we all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under ; even here , above - ground , in the air ; how vast , then , the burden of a whale , bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean ! it must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres . one whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line - of - battle ships , with all their guns , and stores , and men on board . as the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea , gazing down into its eternal blue noon ; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort , nay , not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths ; what landsman would have thought , that beneath all that silence and placidity , the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony ! not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows . seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock . suspended ? and to what ? to three bits of board . is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said --\" canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons ? or his head with fish - spears ? the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold , the spear , the dart , nor the habergeon : he esteemeth iron as straw ; the arrow cannot make him flee ; darts are counted as stubble ; he laugheth at the shaking of a spear !\" this the creature ? this he ? oh ! that unfulfilments should follow the prophets . for with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail , leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea , to hide him from the pequod \\' s fish - spears ! in that sloping afternoon sunlight , the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface , must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half xerxes \\' army . who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head ! \" stand by , men ; he stirs ,\" cried starbuck , as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water , distinctly conducting upwards to them , as by magnetic wires , the life and death throbs of the whale , so that every oarsman felt them in his seat . the next moment , relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows , the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards , as a small icefield will , when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea . \" haul in ! haul in !\" cried starbuck again ; \" he \\' s rising .\" the lines , of which , hardly an instant before , not one hand \\' s breadth could have been gained , were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats , and soon the whale broke water within two ship \\' s lengths of the hunters . his motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion . in most land animals there are certain valves or flood - gates in many of their veins , whereby when wounded , the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions . not so with the whale ; one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non - valvular structure of the blood - vessels , so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon , a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system ; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface , his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams . yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him , and so distant and numerous its interior fountains , that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period ; even as in a drought a river will flow , whose source is in the well - springs of far - off and undiscernible hills . even now , when the boats pulled upon this whale , and perilously drew over his swaying flukes , and the lances were darted into him , they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound , which kept continually playing , while the natural spout - hole in his head was only at intervals , however rapid , sending its affrighted moisture into the air . from this last vent no blood yet came , because no vital part of him had thus far been struck . his life , as they significantly call it , was untouched . as the boats now more closely surrounded him , the whole upper part of his form , with much of it that is ordinarily submerged , was plainly revealed . his eyes , or rather the places where his eyes had been , were beheld . as strange misgrown masses gather in the knot - holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate , so from the points which the whale \\' s eyes had once occupied , now protruded blind bulbs , horribly pitiable to see . but pity there was none . for all his old age , and his one arm , and his blind eyes , he must die the death and be murdered , in order to light the gay bridals and other merry - makings of men , and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all . still rolling in his blood , at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance , the size of a bushel , low down on the flank . \" a nice spot ,\" cried flask ; \" just let me prick him there once .\" \" avast !\" cried starbuck , \" there \\' s no need of that !\" but humane starbuck was too late . at the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound , and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish , the whale now spouting thick blood , with swift fury blindly darted at the craft , bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore , capsizing flask \\' s boat and marring the bows . it was his death stroke . for , by this time , so spent was he by loss of blood , that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made ; lay panting on his side , impotently flapped with his stumped fin , then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world ; turned up the white secrets of his belly ; lay like a log , and died . it was most piteous , that last expiring spout . as when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain , and with half - stifled melancholy gurglings the spray - column lowers and lowers to the ground -- so the last long dying spout of the whale . soon , while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship , the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled . immediately , by starbuck \\' s orders , lines were secured to it at different points , so that ere long every boat was a buoy ; the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords . by very heedful management , when the ship drew nigh , the whale was transferred to her side , and was strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke - chains , for it was plain that unless artificially upheld , the body would at once sink to the bottom . it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade , the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh , on the lower part of the bunch before described . but as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales , with the flesh perfectly healed around them , and no prominence of any kind to denote their place ; therefore , there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to . but still more curious was the fact of a lance - head of stone being found in him , not far from the buried iron , the flesh perfectly firm about it . who had darted that stone lance ? and when ? it might have been darted by some nor \\' west indian long before america was discovered . what other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling . but a sudden stop was put to further discoveries , by the ship \\' s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea , owing to the body \\' s immensely increasing tendency to sink . however , starbuck , who had the ordering of affairs , hung on to it to the last ; hung on to it so resolutely , indeed , that when at length the ship would have been capsized , if still persisting in locking arms with the body ; then , when the command was given to break clear from it , such was the immovable strain upon the timber - heads to which the fluke - chains and cables were fastened , that it was impossible to cast them off . meantime everything in the pequod was aslant . to cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house . the ship groaned and gasped . many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places , by the unnatural dislocation . in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke - chains , to pry them adrift from the timberheads ; and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached , while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk , and the ship seemed on the point of going over . \" hold on , hold on , won \\' t ye ?\" cried stubb to the body , \" don \\' t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink ! by thunder , men , we must do something or go for it . no use prying there ; avast , i say with your handspikes , and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen - knife , and cut the big chains .\" \" knife ? aye , aye ,\" cried queequeg , and seizing the carpenter \\' s heavy hatchet , he leaned out of a porthole , and steel to iron , began slashing at the largest fluke - chains . but a few strokes , full of sparks , were given , when the exceeding strain effected the rest . with a terrific snap , every fastening went adrift ; the ship righted , the carcase sank . now , this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm whale is a very curious thing ; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it . usually the dead sperm whale floats with great buoyancy , with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface . if the only whales that thus sank were old , meagre , and broken - hearted creatures , their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic ; then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking , consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him . but it is not so . for young whales , in the highest health , and swelling with noble aspirations , prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of life , with all their panting lard about them ; even these brawny , buoyant heroes do sometimes sink . be it said , however , that the sperm whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species . where one of that sort go down , twenty right whales do . this difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale ; his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton ; from this incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free . but there are instances where , after the lapse of many hours or several days , the sunken whale again rises , more buoyant than in life . but the reason of this is obvious . gases are generated in him ; he swells to a prodigious magnitude ; becomes a sort of animal balloon . a line - of - battle ship could hardly keep him under then . in the shore whaling , on soundings , among the bays of new zealand , when a right whale gives token of sinking , they fasten buoys to him , with plenty of rope ; so that when the body has gone down , they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again . it was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the pequod \\' s mast - heads , announcing that the jungfrau was again lowering her boats ; though the only spout in sight was that of a fin - back , belonging to the species of uncapturable whales , because of its incredible power of swimming . nevertheless , the fin - back \\' s spout is so similar to the sperm whale \\' s , that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it . and consequently derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute . the virgin crowding all sail , made after her four young keels , and thus they all disappeared far to leeward , still in bold , hopeful chase . oh ! many are the fin - backs , and many are the dericks , my friend . chapter 82 the honour and glory of whaling . there are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method . the more i dive into this matter of whaling , and push my researches up to the very spring - head of it so much the more am i impressed with its great honourableness and antiquity ; and especially when i find so many great demi - gods and heroes , prophets of all sorts , who one way or other have shed distinction upon it , i am transported with the reflection that i myself belong , though but subordinately , to so emblazoned a fraternity . the gallant perseus , a son of jupiter , was the first whaleman ; and to the eternal honour of our calling be it said , that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent . those were the knightly days of our profession , when we only bore arms to succor the distressed , and not to fill men \\' s lamp - feeders . every one knows the fine story of perseus and andromeda ; how the lovely andromeda , the daughter of a king , was tied to a rock on the sea - coast , and as leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off , perseus , the prince of whalemen , intrepidly advancing , harpooned the monster , and delivered and married the maid . it was an admirable artistic exploit , rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day ; inasmuch as this leviathan was slain at the very first dart . and let no man doubt this arkite story ; for in the ancient joppa , now jaffa , on the syrian coast , in one of the pagan temples , there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale , which the city \\' s legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slew . when the romans took joppa , the same skeleton was carried to italy in triumph . what seems most singular and suggestively important in this story , is this : it was from joppa that jonah set sail . akin to the adventure of perseus and andromeda -- indeed , by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it -- is that famous story of st . george and the dragon ; which dragon i maintain to have been a whale ; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together , and often stand for each other . \" thou art as a lion of the waters , and as a dragon of the sea ,\" saith ezekiel ; hereby , plainly meaning a whale ; in truth , some versions of the bible use that word itself . besides , it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st . george but encountered a crawling reptile of the land , instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep . any man may kill a snake , but only a perseus , a st . george , a coffin , have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale . let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us ; for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffin - like shape , and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback , yet considering the great ignorance of those times , when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists ; and considering that as in perseus \\' case , st . george \\' s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach ; and considering that the animal ridden by st . george might have been only a large seal , or sea - horse ; bearing all this in mind , it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene , to hold this so - called dragon no other than the great leviathan himself . in fact , placed before the strict and piercing truth , this whole story will fare like that fish , flesh , and fowl idol of the philistines , dagon by name ; who being planted before the ark of israel , his horse \\' s head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him , and only the stump or fishy part of him remained . thus , then , one of our own noble stamp , even a whaleman , is the tutelary guardian of england ; and by good rights , we harpooneers of nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of st . george . and therefore , let not the knights of that honourable company ( none of whom , i venture to say , have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron ), let them never eye a nantucketer with disdain , since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to st . george \\' s decoration than they . whether to admit hercules among us or not , concerning this i long remained dubious : for though according to the greek mythologies , that antique crockett and kit carson -- that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds , was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale ; still , whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him , that might be mooted . it nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish , unless , indeed , from the inside . nevertheless , he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman ; at any rate the whale caught him , if he did not the whale . i claim him for one of our clan . but , by the best contradictory authorities , this grecian story of hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale ; and vice versa ; certainly they are very similar . if i claim the demigod then , why not the prophet ? nor do heroes , saints , demigods , and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order . our grand master is still to be named ; for like royal kings of old times , we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves . that wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the shaster , which gives us the dread vishnoo , one of the three persons in the godhead of the hindoos ; gives us this divine vishnoo himself for our lord ;-- vishnoo , who , by the first of his ten earthly incarnations , has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale . when brahma , or the god of gods , saith the shaster , resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions , he gave birth to vishnoo , to preside over the work ; but the vedas , or mystical books , whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo before beginning the creation , and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects , these vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters ; so vishnoo became incarnate in a whale , and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths , rescued the sacred volumes . was not this vishnoo a whaleman , then ? even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman ? perseus , st . george , hercules , jonah , and vishnoo ! there \\' s a member - roll for you ! what club but the whaleman \\' s can head off like that ? chapter 83 jonah historically regarded . reference was made to the historical story of jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter . now some nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of jonah and the whale . but then there were some sceptical greeks and romans , who , standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times , equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale , and arion and the dolphin ; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts , for all that . one old sag - harbor whaleman \\' s chief reason for questioning the hebrew story was this :-- he had one of those quaint old - fashioned bibles , embellished with curious , unscientific plates ; one of which represented jonah \\' s whale with two spouts in his head -- a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the leviathan ( the right whale , and the varieties of that order ), concerning which the fishermen have this saying , \" a penny roll would choke him \"; his swallow is so very small . but , to this , bishop jebb \\' s anticipative answer is ready . it is not necessary , hints the bishop , that we consider jonah as tombed in the whale \\' s belly , but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth . and this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop . for truly , the right whale \\' s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist - tables , and comfortably seat all the players . possibly , too , jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth ; but , on second thoughts , the right whale is toothless . another reason which sag - harbor ( he went by that name ) urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet , was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale \\' s gastric juices . but this objection likewise falls to the ground , because a german exegetist supposes that jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale -- even as the french soldiers in the russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents , and crawled into them . besides , it has been divined by other continental commentators , that when jonah was thrown overboard from the joppa ship , he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by , some vessel with a whale for a figure - head ; and , i would add , possibly called \" the whale ,\" as some craft are nowadays christened the \" shark ,\" the \" gull ,\" the \" eagle .\" nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a life - preserver -- an inflated bag of wind -- which the endangered prophet swam to , and so was saved from a watery doom . poor sag - harbor , therefore , seems worsted all round . but he had still another reason for his want of faith . it was this , if i remember right : jonah was swallowed by the whale in the mediterranean sea , and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days \\' journey of nineveh , a city on the tigris , very much more than three days \\' journey across from the nearest point of the mediterranean coast . how is that ? but was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of nineveh ? yes . he might have carried him round by the way of the cape of good hope . but not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the mediterranean , and another passage up the persian gulf and red sea , such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all africa in three days , not to speak of the tigris waters , near the site of nineveh , being too shallow for any whale to swim in . besides , this idea of jonah \\' s weathering the cape of good hope at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great headland from bartholomew diaz , its reputed discoverer , and so make modern history a liar . but all these foolish arguments of old sag - harbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason -- a thing still more reprehensible in him , seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea . i say it only shows his foolish , impious pride , and abominable , devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy . for by a portuguese catholic priest , this very idea of jonah \\' s going to nineveh via the cape of good hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle . and so it was . besides , to this day , the highly enlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah . and some three centuries ago , an english traveller in old harris \\' s voyages , speaks of a turkish mosque built in honour of jonah , in which mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil . chapter 84 pitchpoling . to make them run easily and swiftly , the axles of carriages are anointed ; and for much the same purpose , some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat ; they grease the bottom . nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm , it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage ; considering that oil and water are hostile ; that oil is a sliding thing , and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely . queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat , and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau disappeared , took more than customary pains in that occupation ; crawling under its bottom , where it hung over the side , and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft \\' s bald keel . he seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment . nor did it remain unwarranted by the event . towards noon whales were raised ; but so soon as the ship sailed down to them , they turned and fled with swift precipitancy ; a disordered flight , as of cleopatra \\' s barges from actium . nevertheless , the boats pursued , and stubb \\' s was foremost . by great exertion , tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron ; but the stricken whale , without at all sounding , still continued his horizontal flight , with added fleetness . such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it . it became imperative to lance the flying whale , or be content to lose him . but to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible , he swam so fast and furious . what then remained ? of all the wondrous devices and dexterities , the sleights of hand and countless subtleties , to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced , none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling . small sword , or broad sword , in all its exercises boasts nothing like it . it is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale ; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking , jerking boat , under extreme headway . steel and wood included , the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length ; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon , and also of a lighter material -- pine . it is furnished with a small rope called a warp , of considerable length , by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting . but before going further , it is important to mention here , that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance , yet it is seldom done ; and when done , is still less frequently successful , on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance , which in effect become serious drawbacks . as a general thing , therefore , you must first get fast to a whale , before any pitchpoling comes into play . look now at stubb ; a man who from his humorous , deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies , was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling . look at him ; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat ; wrapt in fleecy foam , the towing whale is forty feet ahead . handling the long lance lightly , glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight , stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand , so as to secure its free end in his grasp , leaving the rest unobstructed . then holding the lance full before his waistband \\' s middle , he levels it at the whale ; when , covering him with it , he steadily depresses the butt - end in his hand , thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm , fifteen feet in the air . he minds you somewhat of a juggler , balancing a long staff on his chin . next moment with a rapid , nameless impulse , in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance , and quivers in the life spot of the whale . instead of sparkling water , he now spouts red blood . \" that drove the spigot out of him !\" cried stubb . \"\\' tis july \\' s immortal fourth ; all fountains must run wine today ! would now , it were old orleans whiskey , or old ohio , or unspeakable old monongahela ! then , tashtego , lad , i \\' d have ye hold a canakin to the jet , and we \\' d drink round it ! yea , verily , hearts alive , we \\' d brew choice punch in the spread of his spout - hole there , and from that live punch - bowl quaff the living stuff .\" again and again to such gamesome talk , the dexterous dart is repeated , the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash . the agonized whale goes into his flurry ; the tow - line is slackened , and the pitchpoler dropping astern , folds his hands , and mutely watches the monster die . chapter 85 the fountain . that for six thousand years -- and no one knows how many millions of ages before -- the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea , and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep , as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots ; and that for some centuries back , thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale , watching these sprinklings and spoutings -- that all this should be , and yet , that down to this blessed minute ( fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o \\' clock p . m . of this sixteenth day of december , a . d . 1851 ), it should still remain a problem , whether these spoutings are , after all , really water , or nothing but vapour -- this is surely a noteworthy thing . let us , then , look at this matter , along with some interesting items contingent . every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills , the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim ; hence , a herring or a cod might live a century , and never once raise its head above the surface . but owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs , like a human being \\' s , the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere . wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world . but he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth , for , in his ordinary attitude , the sperm whale \\' s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface ; and what is still more , his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth . no , he breathes through his spiracle alone ; and this is on the top of his head . if i say , that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality , inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element , which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle , i do not think i shall err ; though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific words . assume it , and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath , he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time . that is to say , he would then live without breathing . anomalous as it may seem , this is precisely the case with the whale , who systematically lives , by intervals , his full hour and more ( when at the bottom ) without drawing a single breath , or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air ; for , remember , he has no gills . how is this ? between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of vermicelli - like vessels , which vessels , when he quits the surface , are completely distended with oxygenated blood . so that for an hour or more , a thousand fathoms in the sea , he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him , just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs . the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable ; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true , seems the more cogent to me , when i consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out , as the fishermen phrase it . this is what i mean . if unmolested , upon rising to the surface , the sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings . say he stays eleven minutes , and jets seventy times , that is , respires seventy breaths ; then whenever he rises again , he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again , to a minute . now , if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him , so that he sounds , he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air . and not till those seventy breaths are told , will he finally go down to stay out his full term below . remark , however , that in different individuals these rates are different ; but in any one they are alike . now , why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out , unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air , ere descending for good ? how obvious is it , too , that this necessity for the whale \\' s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase . for not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught , when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight . not so much thy skill , then , o hunter , as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee ! in man , breathing is incessantly going on -- one breath only serving for two or three pulsations ; so that whatever other business he has to attend to , waking or sleeping , breathe he must , or die he will . but the sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time . it has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout - hole ; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water , then i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him ; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout - hole ; and being so clogged with two elements , it could not be expected to have the power of smelling . but owing to the mystery of the spout -- whether it be water or whether it be vapour -- no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head . sure it is , nevertheless , that the sperm whale has no proper olfactories . but what does he want of them ? no roses , no violets , no cologne - water in the sea . furthermore , as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal , and as that long canal -- like the grand erie canal -- is furnished with a sort of locks ( that open and shut ) for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water , therefore the whale has no voice ; unless you insult him by saying , that when he so strangely rumbles , he talks through his nose . but then again , what has the whale to say ? seldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to this world , unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living . oh ! happy that the world is such an excellent listener ! now , the spouting canal of the sperm whale , chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air , and for several feet laid along , horizontally , just beneath the upper surface of his head , and a little to one side ; this curious canal is very much like a gas - pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street . but the question returns whether this gas - pipe is also a water - pipe ; in other words , whether the spout of the sperm whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath , or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth , and discharged through the spiracle . it is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal ; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle . because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be , when in feeding he accidentally takes in water . but the sperm whale \\' s food is far beneath the surface , and there he cannot spout even if he would . besides , if you regard him very closely , and time him with your watch , you will find that when unmolested , there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration . but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject ? speak out ! you have seen him spout ; then declare what the spout is ; can you not tell water from air ? my dear sir , in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things . i have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all . and as for this whale spout , you might almost stand in it , and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely . the central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it ; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it , when , always , when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout , he is in a prodigious commotion , the water cascading all around him . and if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout , how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapour ; or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout - hole fissure , which is countersunk into the summit of the whale \\' s head ? for even when tranquilly swimming through the mid - day sea in a calm , with his elevated hump sun - dried as a dromedary \\' s in the desert ; even then , the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head , as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain . nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout . it will not do for him to be peering into it , and putting his face in it . you cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it , and bring it away . for even when coming into slight contact with the outer , vapoury shreds of the jet , which will often happen , your skin will feverishly smart , from the acridness of the thing so touching it . and i know one , who coming into still closer contact with the spout , whether with some scientific object in view , or otherwise , i cannot say , the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm . wherefore , among whalemen , the spout is deemed poisonous ; they try to evade it . another thing ; i have heard it said , and i do not much doubt it , that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes , it will blind you . the wisest thing the investigator can do then , it seems to me , is to let this deadly spout alone . still , we can hypothesize , even if we cannot prove and establish . my hypothesis is this : that the spout is nothing but mist . and besides other reasons , to this conclusion i am impelled , by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale ; i account him no common , shallow being , inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings , or near shores ; all other whales sometimes are . he is both ponderous and profound . and i am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings , such as plato , pyrrho , the devil , jupiter , dante , and so on , there always goes up a certain semi - visible steam , while in the act of thinking deep thoughts . while composing a little treatise on eternity , i had the curiosity to place a mirror before me ; and ere long saw reflected there , a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head . the invariable moisture of my hair , while plunged in deep thought , after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic , of an august noon ; this seems an additional argument for the above supposition . and how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty , misty monster , to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea ; his vast , mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour , engendered by his incommunicable contemplations , and that vapour -- as you will sometimes see it -- glorified by a rainbow , as if heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts . for , d \\' ye see , rainbows do not visit the clear air ; they only irradiate vapour . and so , through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind , divine intuitions now and then shoot , enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray . and for this i thank god ; for all have doubts ; many deny ; but doubts or denials , few along with them , have intuitions . doubts of all things earthly , and intuitions of some things heavenly ; this combination makes neither believer nor infidel , but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye . chapter 86 the tail . other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope , and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights ; less celestial , i celebrate a tail . reckoning the largest sized sperm whale \\' s tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man , it comprises upon its upper surface alone , an area of at least fifty square feet . the compact round body of its root expands into two broad , firm , flat palms or flukes , gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness . at the crotch or junction , these flukes slightly overlap , then sideways recede from each other like wings , leaving a wide vacancy between . in no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes . at its utmost expansion in the full grown whale , the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across . the entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews ; but cut into it , and you find that three distinct strata compose it :-- upper , middle , and lower . the fibres in the upper and lower layers , are long and horizontal ; those of the middle one , very short , and running crosswise between the outside layers . this triune structure , as much as anything else , imparts power to the tail . to the student of old roman walls , the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique , and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry . but as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough , the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments , which passing on either side the loins and running down into the flukes , insensibly blend with them , and largely contribute to their might ; so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point . could annihilation occur to matter , this were the thing to do it . nor does this -- its amazing strength , at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions ; where infantileness of ease undulates through a titanism of power . on the contrary , those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it . real strength never impairs beauty or harmony , but it often bestows it ; and in everything imposingly beautiful , strength has much to do with the magic . take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved hercules , and its charm would be gone . as devout eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of goethe , he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man , that seemed as a roman triumphal arch . when angelo paints even god the father in human form , mark what robustness is there . and whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the son , the soft , curled , hermaphroditical italian pictures , in which his idea has been most successfully embodied ; these pictures , so destitute as they are of all brawniness , hint nothing of any power , but the mere negative , feminine one of submission and endurance , which on all hands it is conceded , form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings . such is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of , that whether wielded in sport , or in earnest , or in anger , whatever be the mood it be in , its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace . therein no fairy \\' s arm can transcend it . five great motions are peculiar to it . first , when used as a fin for progression ; second , when used as a mace in battle ; third , in sweeping ; fourth , in lobtailing ; fifth , in peaking flukes . first : being horizontal in its position , the leviathan \\' s tail acts in a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures . it never wriggles . in man or fish , wriggling is a sign of inferiority . to the whale , his tail is the sole means of propulsion . scroll - wise coiled forwards beneath the body , and then rapidly sprung backwards , it is this which gives that singular darting , leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming . his side - fins only serve to steer by . second : it is a little significant , that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw , nevertheless , in his conflicts with man , he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail . in striking at a boat , he swiftly curves away his flukes from it , and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil . if it be made in the unobstructed air , especially if it descend to its mark , the stroke is then simply irresistible . no ribs of man or boat can withstand it . your only salvation lies in eluding it ; but if it comes sideways through the opposing water , then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale boat , and the elasticity of its materials , a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two , a sort of stitch in the side , is generally the most serious result . these submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery , that they are accounted mere child \\' s play . some one strips off a frock , and the hole is stopped . third : i cannot demonstrate it , but it seems to me , that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail ; for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant \\' s trunk . this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping , when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea ; and if he feel but a sailor \\' s whisker , woe to that sailor , whiskers and all . what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch ! had this tail any prehensile power , i should straightway bethink me of darmonodes \\' elephant that so frequented the flower - market , and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels , and then caressed their zones . on more accounts than one , a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail ; for i have heard of yet another elephant , that when wounded in the fight , curved round his trunk and extracted the dart . fourth : stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas , you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity , and kitten - like , he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth . but still you see his power in his play . the broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air ; then smiting the surface , the thunderous concussion resounds for miles . you would almost think a great gun had been discharged ; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity , you would think that that was the smoke from the touch - hole . fifth : as in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back , they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface ; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps , his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air , and so remain vibrating a moment , till they downwards shoot out of view . excepting the sublime breach -- somewhere else to be described -- this peaking of the whale \\' s flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature . out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven . so in dreams , have i seen majestic satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell . but in gazing at such scenes , it is all in all what mood you are in ; if in the dantean , the devils will occur to you ; if in that of isaiah , the archangels . standing at the mast - head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea , i once saw a large herd of whales in the east , all heading towards the sun , and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes . as it seemed to me at the time , such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld , even in persia , the home of the fire worshippers . as ptolemy philopater testified of the african elephant , i then testified of the whale , pronouncing him the most devout of all beings . for according to king juba , the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence . the chance comparison in this chapter , between the whale and the elephant , so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned , should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality , much less the creatures to which they respectively belong . for as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to leviathan , so , compared with leviathan \\' s tail , his trunk is but the stalk of a lily . the most direful blow from the elephant \\' s trunk were as the playful tap of a fan , compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale \\' s ponderous flukes , which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air , very much as an indian juggler tosses his balls .* * though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous , inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant ; nevertheless , there are not wanting some points of curious similitude ; among these is the spout . it is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk , and then elevating it , jet it forth in a stream . the more i consider this mighty tail , the more do i deplore my inability to express it . at times there are gestures in it , which , though they would well grace the hand of man , remain wholly inexplicable . in an extensive herd , so remarkable , occasionally , are these mystic gestures , that i have heard hunters who have declared them akin to free - mason signs and symbols ; that the whale , indeed , by these methods intelligently conversed with the world . nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body , full of strangeness , and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant . dissect him how i may , then , i but go skin deep ; i know him not , and never will . but if i know not even the tail of this whale , how understand his head ? much more , how comprehend his face , when face he has none ? thou shalt see my back parts , my tail , he seems to say , but my face shall not be seen . but i cannot completely make out his back parts ; and hint what he will about his face , i say again he has no face . chapter 87 the grand armada . the long and narrow peninsula of malacca , extending south - eastward from the territories of birmah , forms the most southerly point of all asia . in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of sumatra , java , bally , and timor ; which , with many others , form a vast mole , or rampart , lengthwise connecting asia with australia , and dividing the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes . this rampart is pierced by several sally - ports for the convenience of ships and whales ; conspicuous among which are the straits of sunda and malacca . by the straits of sunda , chiefly , vessels bound to china from the west , emerge into the china seas . those narrow straits of sunda divide sumatra from java ; and standing midway in that vast rampart of islands , buttressed by that bold green promontory , known to seamen as java head ; they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire : and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices , and silks , and jewels , and gold , and ivory , with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched , it seems a significant provision of nature , that such treasures , by the very formation of the land , should at least bear the appearance , however ineffectual , of being guarded from the all - grasping western world . the shores of the straits of sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the mediterranean , the baltic , and the propontis . unlike the danes , these orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top - sails from the endless procession of ships before the wind , which for centuries past , by night and by day , have passed between the islands of sumatra and java , freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east . but while they freely waive a ceremonial like this , they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute . time out of mind the piratical proas of the malays , lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of sumatra , have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits , fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears . though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of european cruisers , the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed ; yet , even at the present day , we occasionally hear of english and american vessels , which , in those waters , have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged . with a fair , fresh wind , the pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits ; ahab purposing to pass through them into the javan sea , and thence , cruising northwards , over waters known to be frequented here and there by the sperm whale , sweep inshore by the philippine islands , and gain the far coast of japan , in time for the great whaling season there . by these means , the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost all the known sperm whale cruising grounds of the world , previous to descending upon the line in the pacific ; where ahab , though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit , firmly counted upon giving battle to moby dick , in the sea he was most known to frequent ; and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it . but how now ? in this zoned quest , does ahab touch no land ? does his crew drink air ? surely , he will stop for water . nay . for a long time , now , the circus - running sun has raced within his fiery ring , and needs no sustenance but what \\' s in himself . so ahab . mark this , too , in the whaler . while other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff , to be transferred to foreign wharves ; the world - wandering whale - ship carries no cargo but herself and crew , their weapons and their wants . she has a whole lake \\' s contents bottled in her ample hold . she is ballasted with utilities ; not altogether with unusable pig - lead and kentledge . she carries years \\' water in her . clear old prime nantucket water ; which , when three years afloat , the nantucketer , in the pacific , prefers to drink before the brackish fluid , but yesterday rafted off in casks , from the peruvian or indian streams . hence it is , that , while other ships may have gone to china from new york , and back again , touching at a score of ports , the whale - ship , in all that interval , may not have sighted one grain of soil ; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves . so that did you carry them the news that another flood had come ; they would only answer --\" well , boys , here \\' s the ark !\" now , as many sperm whales had been captured off the western coast of java , in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda ; indeed , as most of the ground , roundabout , was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising ; therefore , as the pequod gained more and more upon java head , the look - outs were repeatedly hailed , and admonished to keep wide awake . but though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow , and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air , yet not a single jet was descried . almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts , the ship had well nigh entered the straits , when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft , and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us . but here be it premised , that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans , the sperm whales , instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies , as in former times , are now frequently met with in extensive herds , sometimes embracing so great a multitude , that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection . to this aggregation of the sperm whale into such immense caravans , may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds , you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together , without being greeted by a single spout ; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands . broad on both bows , at the distance of some two or three miles , and forming a great semicircle , embracing one half of the level horizon , a continuous chain of whale - jets were up - playing and sparkling in the noon - day air . unlike the straight perpendicular twin - jets of the right whale , which , dividing at top , fall over in two branches , like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow , the single forward - slanting spout of the sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist , continually rising and falling away to leeward . seen from the pequod \\' s deck , then , as she would rise on a high hill of the sea , this host of vapoury spouts , individually curling up into the air , and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze , showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis , descried of a balmy autumnal morning , by some horseman on a height . as marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains , accelerate their march , all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear , and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain ; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits ; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle , and swimming on , in one solid , but still crescentic centre . crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them ; the harpooneers handling their weapons , and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats . if the wind only held , little doubt had they , that chased through these straits of sunda , the vast host would only deploy into the oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number . and who could tell whether , in that congregated caravan , moby dick himself might not temporarily be swimming , like the worshipped white - elephant in the coronation procession of the siamese ! so with stun - sail piled on stun - sail , we sailed along , driving these leviathans before us ; when , of a sudden , the voice of tashtego was heard , loudly directing attention to something in our wake . corresponding to the crescent in our van , we beheld another in our rear . it seemed formed of detached white vapours , rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales ; only they did not so completely come and go ; for they constantly hovered , without finally disappearing . levelling his glass at this sight , ahab quickly revolved in his pivot - hole , crying , \" aloft there , and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails ;-- malays , sir , and after us !\" as if too long lurking behind the headlands , till the pequod should fairly have entered the straits , these rascally asiatics were now in hot pursuit , to make up for their over - cautious delay . but when the swift pequod , with a fresh leading wind , was herself in hot chase ; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit ,-- mere riding - whips and rowels to her , that they were . as with glass under arm , ahab to - and - fro paced the deck ; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased , and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him ; some such fancy as the above seemed his . and when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing , and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance , and beheld , how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end ; and not only that , but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curses ;-- when all these conceits had passed through his brain , ahab \\' s brow was left gaunt and ribbed , like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it , without being able to drag the firm thing from its place . but thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew ; and when , after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern , the pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra side , emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond ; then , the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship , than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the malays . but still driving on in the wake of the whales , at length they seemed abating their speed ; gradually the ship neared them ; and the wind now dying away , word was passed to spring to the boats . but no sooner did the herd , by some presumed wonderful instinct of the sperm whale , become notified of the three keels that were after them ,-- though as yet a mile in their rear ,-- than they rallied again , and forming in close ranks and battalions , so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets , moved on with redoubled velocity . stripped to our shirts and drawers , we sprang to the white - ash , and after several hours \\' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase , when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution , which , when the fishermen perceive it in the whale , they say he is gallied . the compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming , were now broken up in one measureless rout ; and like king porus \\' elephants in the indian battle with alexander , they seemed going mad with consternation . in all directions expanding in vast irregular circles , and aimlessly swimming hither and thither , by their short thick spoutings , they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic . this was still more strangely evinced by those of their number , who , completely paralysed as it were , helplessly floated like water - logged dismantled ships on the sea . had these leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep , pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves , they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay . but this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures . though banding together in tens of thousands , the lion - maned buffaloes of the west have fled before a solitary horseman . witness , too , all human beings , how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre \\' s pit , they will , at the slightest alarm of fire , rush helter - skelter for the outlets , crowding , trampling , jamming , and remorselessly dashing each other to death . best , therefore , withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us , for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men . though many of the whales , as has been said , were in violent motion , yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated , but collectively remained in one place . as is customary in those cases , the boats at once separated , each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal . in about three minutes \\' time , queequeg \\' s harpoon was flung ; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces , and then running away with us like light , steered straight for the heart of the herd . though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances , is in no wise unprecedented ; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated ; yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery . for as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal , you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb . as , blind and deaf , the whale plunged forward , as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him ; as we thus tore a white gash in the sea , on all sides menaced as we flew , by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us ; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice - isles in a tempest , and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits , knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed . but not a bit daunted , queequeg steered us manfully ; now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance ; now edging away from that , whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead , while all the time , starbuck stood up in the bows , lance in hand , pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts , for there was no time to make long ones . nor were the oarsmen quite idle , though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with . they chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business . \" out of the way , commodore !\" cried one , to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface , and for an instant threatened to swamp us . \" hard down with your tail , there !\" cried a second to another , which , close to our gunwale , seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fan - like extremity . all whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances , originally invented by the nantucket indians , called druggs . two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together , so that they cross each other \\' s grain at right angles ; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block , and the other end of the line being looped , it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon . it is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used . for then , more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time . but sperm whales are not every day encountered ; while you may , then , you must kill all you can . and if you cannot kill them all at once , you must wing them , so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure . hence it is , that at times like these the drugg , comes into requisition . our boat was furnished with three of them . the first and second were successfully darted , and we saw the whales staggeringly running off , fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg . they were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball . but upon flinging the third , in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block , it caught under one of the seats of the boat , and in an instant tore it out and carried it away , dropping the oarsman in the boat \\' s bottom as the seat slid from under him . on both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks , but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in , and so stopped the leaks for the time . it had been next to impossible to dart these drugged - harpoons , were it not that as we advanced into the herd , our whale \\' s way greatly diminished ; moreover , that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion , the direful disorders seemed waning . so that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out , and the towing whale sideways vanished ; then , with the tapering force of his parting momentum , we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal , as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake . here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales , were heard but not felt . in this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin - like surface , called a sleek , produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods . yes , we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion . and still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles , and saw successive pods of whales , eight or ten in each , swiftly going round and round , like multiplied spans of horses in a ring ; and so closely shoulder to shoulder , that a titanic circus - rider might easily have over - arched the middle ones , and so have gone round on their backs . owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales , more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd , no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us . we must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in ; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up . keeping at the centre of the lake , we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves ; the women and children of this routed host . now , inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles , and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles , the entire area at this juncture , embraced by the whole multitude , must have contained at least two or three square miles . at any rate -- though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive -- spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon . i mention this circumstance , because , as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold ; and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping ; or , possibly , being so young , unsophisticated , and every way innocent and inexperienced ; however it may have been , these smaller whales -- now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake -- evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence , or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at . like household dogs they came snuffling round us , right up to our gunwales , and touching them ; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them . queequeg patted their foreheads ; starbuck scratched their backs with his lance ; but fearful of the consequences , for the time refrained from darting it . but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface , another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side . for , suspended in those watery vaults , floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales , and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers . the lake , as i have hinted , was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent ; and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast , as if leading two different lives at the time ; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment , be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence ;-- even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us , but not at us , as if we were but a bit of gulfweed in their new - born sight . floating on their sides , the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us . one of these little infants , that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old , might have measured some fourteen feet in length , and some six feet in girth . he was a little frisky ; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule ; where , tail to head , and all ready for the final spring , the unborn whale lies bent like a tartar \\' s bow . the delicate side - fins , and the palms of his flukes , still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby \\' s ears newly arrived from foreign parts . \" line ! line !\" cried queequeg , looking over the gunwale ; \" him fast ! him fast !-- who line him ! who struck ?-- two whale ; one big , one little !\" \" what ails ye , man ?\" cried starbuck . \" look - e here ,\" said queequeg , pointing down . as when the stricken whale , that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope ; as , after deep sounding , he floats up again , and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air ; so now , starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of madame leviathan , by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam . not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase , this natural line , with the maternal end loose , becomes entangled with the hempen one , so that the cub is thereby trapped . some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond . we saw young leviathan amours in the deep .* * the sperm whale , as with all other species of the leviathan , but unlike most other fish , breeds indifferently at all seasons ; after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months , producing but one at a time ; though in some few known instances giving birth to an esau and jacob :-- a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats , curiously situated , one on each side of the anus ; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that . when by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter \\' s lance , the mother \\' s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods . the milk is very sweet and rich ; it has been tasted by man ; it might do well with strawberries . when overflowing with mutual esteem , the whales salute more hominum . and thus , though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and affrights , did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments ; yea , serenely revelled in dalliance and delight . but even so , amid the tornadoed atlantic of my being , do i myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm ; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me , deep down and deep inland there i still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy . meanwhile , as we thus lay entranced , the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats , still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host ; or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle , where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them . but the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles , was nothing to what at last met our eyes . it is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert , to seek to hamstring him , as it were , by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail - tendon . it is done by darting a short - handled cutting - spade , to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again . a whale wounded ( as we afterwards learned ) in this part , but not effectually , as it seemed , had broken away from the boat , carrying along with him half of the harpoon line ; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound , he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado arnold , at the battle of saratoga , carrying dismay wherever he went . but agonizing as was the wound of this whale , and an appalling spectacle enough , any way ; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd , was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us . but at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery , this whale had become entangled in the harpoon - line that he towed ; he had also run away with the cutting - spade in him ; and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon , had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon - line round his tail , the cutting - spade itself had worked loose from his flesh . so that tormented to madness , he was now churning through the water , violently flailing with his flexible tail , and tossing the keen spade about him , wounding and murdering his own comrades . this terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright . first , the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little , and tumble against each other , as if lifted by half spent billows from afar ; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell ; the submarine bridal - chambers and nurseries vanished ; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters . yes , the long calm was departing . a low advancing hum was soon heard ; and then like to the tumultuous masses of block - ice when the great river hudson breaks up in spring , the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre , as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain . instantly starbuck and queequeg changed places ; starbuck taking the stern . \" oars ! oars !\" he intensely whispered , seizing the helm --\" gripe your oars , and clutch your souls , now ! my god , men , stand by ! shove him off , you queequeg -- the whale there !-- prick him !-- hit him ! stand up -- stand up , and stay so ! spring , men -- pull , men ; never mind their backs -- scrape them !-- scrape away !\" the boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks , leaving a narrow dardanelles between their long lengths . but by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening ; then giving way rapidly , and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet . after many similar hair - breadth escapes , we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles , but now crossed by random whales , all violently making for one centre . this lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of queequeg \\' s hat , who , while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales , had his hat taken clean from his head by the air - eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by . riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was , it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement ; for having clumped together at last in one dense body , they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness . further pursuit was useless ; but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern , and likewise to secure one which flask had killed and waifed . the waif is a pennoned pole , two or three of which are carried by every boat ; and which , when additional game is at hand , are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale , both to mark its place on the sea , and also as token of prior possession , should the boats of any other ship draw near . the result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the fishery ,-- the more whales the less fish . of all the drugged whales only one was captured . the rest contrived to escape for the time , but only to be taken , as will hereafter be seen , by some other craft than the pequod . chapter 88 schools and schoolmasters . the previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of sperm whales , and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations . now , though such great bodies are at times encountered , yet , as must have been seen , even at the present day , small detached bands are occasionally observed , embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each . such bands are known as schools . they generally are of two sorts ; those composed almost entirely of females , and those mustering none but young vigorous males , or bulls , as they are familiarly designated . in cavalier attendance upon the school of females , you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude , but not old ; who , upon any alarm , evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies . in truth , this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman , swimming about over the watery world , surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem . the contrast between this ottoman and his concubines is striking ; because , while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions , the ladies , even at full growth , are not more than one - third of the bulk of an average - sized male . they are comparatively delicate , indeed ; i dare say , not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist . nevertheless , it cannot be denied , that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to embonpoint . it is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings . like fashionables , they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety . you meet them on the line in time for the full flower of the equatorial feeding season , having just returned , perhaps , from spending the summer in the northern seas , and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth . by the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the equator awhile , they start for the oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there , and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year . when serenely advancing on one of these journeys , if any strange suspicious sights are seen , my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family . should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan coming that way , presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies , with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him , and chases him away ! high times , indeed , if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss ; though do what the bashaw will , he cannot keep the most notorious lothario out of his bed ; for , alas ! all fish bed in common . as ashore , the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers ; just so with the whales , who sometimes come to deadly battle , and all for love . they fence with their long lower jaws , sometimes locking them together , and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers . not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters ,-- furrowed heads , broken teeth , scolloped fins ; and in some instances , wrenched and dislocated mouths . but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harem \\' s lord , then is it very diverting to watch that lord . gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile , still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario , like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines . granting other whales to be in sight , the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these grand turks ; for these grand turks are too lavish of their strength , and hence their unctuousness is small . as for the sons and the daughters they beget , why , those sons and daughters must take care of themselves ; at least , with only the maternal help . for like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named , my lord whale has no taste for the nursery , however much for the bower ; and so , being a great traveller , he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world ; every baby an exotic . in good time , nevertheless , as the ardour of youth declines ; as years and dumps increase ; as reflection lends her solemn pauses ; in short , as a general lassitude overtakes the sated turk ; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens ; our ottoman enters upon the impotent , repentant , admonitory stage of life , forswears , disbands the harem , and grown to an exemplary , sulky old soul , goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers , and warning each young leviathan from his amorous errors . now , as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school , so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster . it is therefore not in strict character , however admirably satirical , that after going to school himself , he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there , but the folly of it . his title , schoolmaster , would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself , but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale , must have read the memoirs of vidocq , and informed himself what sort of a country - schoolmaster that famous frenchman was in his younger days , and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils . the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years , is true of all aged sperm whales . almost universally , a lone whale -- as a solitary leviathan is called -- proves an ancient one . like venerable moss - bearded daniel boone , he will have no one near him but nature herself ; and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters , and the best of wives she is , though she keeps so many moody secrets . the schools composing none but young and vigorous males , previously mentioned , offer a strong contrast to the harem schools . for while those female whales are characteristically timid , the young males , or forty - barrel - bulls , as they call them , are by far the most pugnacious of all leviathans , and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter ; excepting those wondrous grey - headed , grizzled whales , sometimes met , and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout . the forty - barrel - bull schools are larger than the harem schools . like a mob of young collegians , they are full of fight , fun , and wickedness , tumbling round the world at such a reckless , rollicking rate , that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at yale or harvard . they soon relinquish this turbulence though , and when about three - fourths grown , break up , and separately go about in quest of settlements , that is , harems . another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes . say you strike a forty - barrel - bull -- poor devil ! all his comrades quit him . but strike a member of the harem school , and her companions swim around her with every token of concern , sometimes lingering so near her and so long , as themselves to fall a prey . chapter 89 fast - fish and loose - fish . the allusion to the waif and waif - poles in the last chapter but one , necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery , of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge . it frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company , a whale may be struck by one vessel , then escape , and be finally killed and captured by another vessel ; and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies , all partaking of this one grand feature . for example ,-- after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale , the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm ; and drifting far away to leeward , be retaken by a second whaler , who , in a calm , snugly tows it alongside , without risk of life or line . thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen , were there not some written or unwritten , universal , undisputed law applicable to all cases . perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment , was that of holland . it was decreed by the states - general in a . d . 1695 . but though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law , yet the american fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter . they have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses justinian \\' s pandects and the by - laws of the chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other people \\' s business . yes ; these laws might be engraven on a queen anne \\' s forthing , or the barb of a harpoon , and worn round the neck , so small are they . i . a fast - fish belongs to the party fast to it . ii . a loose - fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it . but what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it , which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it . first : what is a fast - fish ? alive or dead a fish is technically fast , when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat , by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants ,-- a mast , an oar , a nine - inch cable , a telegraph wire , or a strand of cobweb , it is all the same . likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif , or any other recognised symbol of possession ; so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside , as well as their intention so to do . these are scientific commentaries ; but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks -- the coke - upon - littleton of the fist . true , among the more upright and honourable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases , where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party . but others are by no means so scrupulous . some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale - trover litigated in england , wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the northern seas ; and when indeed they ( the plaintiffs ) had succeeded in harpooning the fish ; they were at last , through peril of their lives , obliged to forsake not only their lines , but their boat itself . ultimately the defendants ( the crew of another ship ) came up with the whale , struck , killed , seized , and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs . and when those defendants were remonstrated with , their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs \\' teeth , and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done , he would now retain their line , harpoons , and boat , which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure . wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale , line , harpoons , and boat . mr . erskine was counsel for the defendants ; lord ellenborough was the judge . in the course of the defence , the witty erskine went on to illustrate his position , by alluding to a recent crim . con . case , wherein a gentleman , after in vain trying to bridle his wife \\' s viciousness , had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life ; but in the course of years , repenting of that step , he instituted an action to recover possession of her . erskine was on the other side ; and he then supported it by saying , that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady , and had once had her fast , and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness , had at last abandoned her ; yet abandon her he did , so that she became a loose - fish ; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re - harpooned her , the lady then became that subsequent gentleman \\' s property , along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her . now in the present case erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other . these pleadings , and the counter pleadings , being duly heard , the very learned judge in set terms decided , to wit ,-- that as for the boat , he awarded it to the plaintiffs , because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives ; but that with regard to the controverted whale , harpoons , and line , they belonged to the defendants ; the whale , because it was a loose - fish at the time of the final capture ; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them , it ( the fish ) acquired a property in those articles ; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them . now the defendants afterwards took the fish ; ergo , the aforesaid articles were theirs . a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge , might possibly object to it . but ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter , the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted , and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough in the above cited case ; these two laws touching fast - fish and loose - fish , i say , will , on reflection , be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence ; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture , the temple of the law , like the temple of the philistines , has but two props to stand on . is it not a saying in every one \\' s mouth , possession is half of the law : that is , regardless of how the thing came into possession ? but often possession is the whole of the law . what are the sinews and souls of russian serfs and republican slaves but fast - fish , whereof possession is the whole of the law ? what to the rapacious landlord is the widow \\' s last mite but a fast - fish ? what is yonder undetected villain \\' s marble mansion with a door - plate for a waif ; what is that but a fast - fish ? what is the ruinous discount which mordecai , the broker , gets from poor woebegone , the bankrupt , on a loan to keep woebegone \\' s family from starvation ; what is that ruinous discount but a fast - fish ? what is the archbishop of savesoul \\' s income of l100 , 000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken - backed laborers ( all sure of heaven without any of savesoul \\' s help ) what is that globular l100 , 000 but a fast - fish ? what are the duke of dunder \\' s hereditary towns and hamlets but fast - fish ? what to that redoubted harpooneer , john bull , is poor ireland , but a fast - fish ? what to that apostolic lancer , brother jonathan , is texas but a fast - fish ? and concerning all these , is not possession the whole of the law ? but if the doctrine of fast - fish be pretty generally applicable , the kindred doctrine of loose - fish is still more widely so . that is internationally and universally applicable . what was america in 1492 but a loose - fish , in which columbus struck the spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress ? what was poland to the czar ? what greece to the turk ? what india to england ? what at last will mexico be to the united states ? all loose - fish . what are the rights of man and the liberties of the world but loose - fish ? what all men \\' s minds and opinions but loose - fish ? what is the principle of religious belief in them but a loose - fish ? what to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but loose - fish ? what is the great globe itself but a loose - fish ? and what are you , reader , but a loose - fish and a fast - fish , too ? chapter 90 heads or tails . \" de balena vero sufficit , si rex habeat caput , et regina caudam .\" bracton , l . 3 , c . 3 . latin from the books of the laws of england , which taken along with the context , means , that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land , the king , as honourary grand harpooneer , must have the head , and the queen be respectfully presented with the tail . a division which , in the whale , is much like halving an apple ; there is no intermediate remainder . now as this law , under a modified form , is to this day in force in england ; and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of fast and loose - fish , it is here treated of in a separate chapter , on the same courteous principle that prompts the english railways to be at the expense of a separate car , specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty . in the first place , in curious proof of the fact that the above - mentioned law is still in force , i proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years . it seems that some honest mariners of dover , or sandwich , or some one of the cinque ports , had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore . now the cinque ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle , called a lord warden . holding the office directly from the crown , i believe , all the royal emoluments incident to the cinque port territories become by assignment his . by some writers this office is called a sinecure . but not so . because the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites ; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them . now when these poor sun - burnt mariners , bare - footed , and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs , had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry , promising themselves a good l150 from the precious oil and bone ; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives , and good ale with their cronies , upon the strength of their respective shares ; up steps a very learned and most christian and charitable gentleman , with a copy of blackstone under his arm ; and laying it upon the whale \\' s head , he says --\" hands off ! this fish , my masters , is a fast - fish . i seize it as the lord warden \\' s .\" upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation -- so truly english -- knowing not what to say , fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round ; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger . but that did in nowise mend the matter , or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of blackstone . at length one of them , after long scratching about for his ideas , made bold to speak , \" please , sir , who is the lord warden ?\" \" the duke .\" \" but the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish ?\" \" it is his .\" \" we have been at great trouble , and peril , and some expense , and is all that to go to the duke \\' s benefit ; we getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters ?\" \" it is his .\" \" is the duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood ?\" \" it is his .\" \" i thought to relieve my old bed - ridden mother by part of my share of this whale .\" \" it is his .\" \" won \\' t the duke be content with a quarter or a half ?\" \" it is his .\" in a word , the whale was seized and sold , and his grace the duke of wellington received the money . thinking that viewed in some particular lights , the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed , under the circumstances , a rather hard one , an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace , begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration . to which my lord duke in substance replied ( both letters were published ) that he had already done so , and received the money , and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he ( the reverend gentleman ) would decline meddling with other people \\' s business . is this the still militant old man , standing at the corners of the three kingdoms , on all hands coercing alms of beggars ? it will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the duke to the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign . we must needs inquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally invested with that right . the law itself has already been set forth . but plowdon gives us the reason for it . says plowdon , the whale so caught belongs to the king and queen , \" because of its superior excellence .\" and by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters . but why should the king have the head , and the queen the tail ? a reason for that , ye lawyers ! in his treatise on \" queen - gold ,\" or queen - pinmoney , an old king \\' s bench author , one william prynne , thus discourseth : \" ye tail is ye queen \\' s , that ye queen \\' s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone .\" now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or right whale was largely used in ladies \\' bodices . but this same bone is not in the tail ; it is in the head , which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like prynne . but is the queen a mermaid , to be presented with a tail ? an allegorical meaning may lurk here . there are two royal fish so styled by the english law writers -- the whale and the sturgeon ; both royal property under certain limitations , and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown \\' s ordinary revenue . i know not that any other author has hinted of the matter ; but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale , the king receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish , which , symbolically regarded , may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality . and thus there seems a reason in all things , even in law . chapter 91 the pequod meets the rose - bud . \" in vain it was to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of this leviathan , insufferable fetor denying not inquiry .\" sir t . browne , v . e . it was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted , and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy , vapoury , mid - day sea , that the many noses on the pequod \\' s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft . a peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea . \" i will bet something now ,\" said stubb , \" that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day . i thought they would keel up before long .\" presently , the vapours in advance slid aside ; and there in the distance lay a ship , whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside . as we glided nearer , the stranger showed french colours from his peak ; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea - fowl that circled , and hovered , and swooped around him , it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale , that is , a whale that has died unmolested on the sea , and so floated an unappropriated corpse . it may well be conceived , what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale ; worse than an assyrian city in the plague , when the living are incompetent to bury the departed . so intolerable indeed is it regarded by some , that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it . yet are there those who will still do it ; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality , and by no means of the nature of attar - of - rose . coming still nearer with the expiring breeze , we saw that the frenchman had a second whale alongside ; and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first . in truth , it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia , or indigestion ; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil . nevertheless , in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this , however much he may shun blasted whales in general . the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger , that stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spade - pole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales . \" there \\' s a pretty fellow , now ,\" he banteringly laughed , standing in the ship \\' s bows , \" there \\' s a jackal for ye ! i well know that these crappoes of frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery ; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers , mistaking them for sperm whale spouts ; yes , and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles , and cases of snuffers , foreseeing that all the oil they will get won \\' t be enough to dip the captain \\' s wick into ; aye , we all know these things ; but look ye , here \\' s a crappo that is content with our leavings , the drugged whale there , i mean ; aye , and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there . poor devil ! i say , pass round a hat , some one , and let \\' s make him a present of a little oil for dear charity \\' s sake . for what oil he \\' ll get from that drugged whale there , wouldn \\' t be fit to burn in a jail ; no , not in a condemned cell . and as for the other whale , why , i \\' ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours , than he \\' ll get from that bundle of bones ; though , now that i think of it , it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil ; yes , ambergris . i wonder now if our old man has thought of that . it \\' s worth trying . yes , i \\' m for it ;\" and so saying he started for the quarter - deck . by this time the faint air had become a complete calm ; so that whether or no , the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell , with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again . issuing from the cabin , stubb now called his boat \\' s crew , and pulled off for the stranger . drawing across her bow , he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful french taste , the upper part of her stem - piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk , was painted green , and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there ; the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour . upon her head boards , in large gilt letters , he read \" bouton de rose ,\"-- rose - button , or rose - bud ; and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship . though stubb did not understand the bouton part of the inscription , yet the word rose , and the bulbous figure - head put together , sufficiently explained the whole to him . \" a wooden rose - bud , eh ?\" he cried with his hand to his nose , \" that will do very well ; but how like all creation it smells !\" now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck , he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side , and thus come close to the blasted whale ; and so talk over it . arrived then at this spot , with one hand still to his nose , he bawled --\" bouton - de - rose , ahoy ! are there any of you bouton - de - roses that speak english ?\" \" yes ,\" rejoined a guernsey - man from the bulwarks , who turned out to be the chief - mate . \" well , then , my bouton - de - rose - bud , have you seen the white whale ?\" \" what whale ?\" \" the white whale -- a sperm whale -- moby dick , have ye seen him ? \" never heard of such a whale . cachalot blanche ! white whale -- no .\" \" very good , then ; good bye now , and i \\' ll call again in a minute .\" then rapidly pulling back towards the pequod , and seeing ahab leaning over the quarter - deck rail awaiting his report , he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted --\" no , sir ! no !\" upon which ahab retired , and stubb returned to the frenchman . he now perceived that the guernsey - man , who had just got into the chains , and was using a cutting - spade , had slung his nose in a sort of bag . \" what \\' s the matter with your nose , there ?\" said stubb . \" broke it ?\" \" i wish it was broken , or that i didn \\' t have any nose at all !\" answered the guernsey - man , who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much . \" but what are you holding yours for ?\" \" oh , nothing ! it \\' s a wax nose ; i have to hold it on . fine day , ain \\' t it ? air rather gardenny , i should say ; throw us a bunch of posies , will ye , bouton - de - rose ?\" \" what in the devil \\' s name do you want here ?\" roared the guernseyman , flying into a sudden passion . \" oh ! keep cool -- cool ? yes , that \\' s the word ! why don \\' t you pack those whales in ice while you \\' re working at \\' em ? but joking aside , though ; do you know , rose - bud , that it \\' s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales ? as for that dried up one , there , he hasn \\' t a gill in his whole carcase .\" \" i know that well enough ; but , d \\' ye see , the captain here won \\' t believe it ; this is his first voyage ; he was a cologne manufacturer before . but come aboard , and mayhap he \\' ll believe you , if he won \\' t me ; and so i \\' ll get out of this dirty scrape .\" \" anything to oblige ye , my sweet and pleasant fellow ,\" rejoined stubb , and with that he soon mounted to the deck . there a queer scene presented itself . the sailors , in tasselled caps of red worsted , were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales . but they worked rather slow and talked very fast , and seemed in anything but a good humor . all their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib - booms . now and then pairs of them would drop their work , and run up to the mast - head to get some fresh air . some thinking they would catch the plague , dipped oakum in coal - tar , and at intervals held it to their nostrils . others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl , were vigorously puffing tobacco - smoke , so that it constantly filled their olfactories . stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the captain \\' s round - house abaft ; and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door , which was held ajar from within . this was the tormented surgeon , who , after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day , had betaken himself to the captain \\' s round - house ( cabinet he called it ) to avoid the pest ; but still , could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times . marking all this , stubb argued well for his scheme , and turning to the guernsey - man had a little chat with him , during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus , who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle . sounding him carefully , stubb further perceived that the guernsey - man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris . he therefore held his peace on that head , but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him , so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the captain , without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity . according to this little plan of theirs , the guernsey - man , under cover of an interpreter \\' s office , was to tell the captain what he pleased , but as coming from stubb ; and as for stubb , he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview . by this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin . he was a small and dark , but rather delicate looking man for a sea - captain , with large whiskers and moustache , however ; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch - seals at his side . to this gentleman , stubb was now politely introduced by the guernsey - man , who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them . \" what shall i say to him first ?\" said he . \" why ,\" said stubb , eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals , \" you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me , though i don \\' t pretend to be a judge .\" \" he says , monsieur ,\" said the guernsey - man , in french , turning to his captain , \" that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel , whose captain and chief - mate , with six sailors , had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside .\" upon this the captain started , and eagerly desired to know more . \" what now ?\" said the guernsey - man to stubb . \" why , since he takes it so easy , tell him that now i have eyed him carefully , i \\' m quite certain that he \\' s no more fit to command a whale - ship than a st . jago monkey . in fact , tell him from me he \\' s a baboon .\" \" he vows and declares , monsieur , that the other whale , the dried one , is far more deadly than the blasted one ; in fine , monsieur , he conjures us , as we value our lives , to cut loose from these fish .\" instantly the captain ran forward , and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting - tackles , and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship . \" what now ?\" said the guernsey - man , when the captain had returned to them . \" why , let me see ; yes , you may as well tell him now that -- that -- in fact , tell him i \\' ve diddled him , and ( aside to himself ) perhaps somebody else .\" \" he says , monsieur , that he \\' s very happy to have been of any service to us .\" hearing this , the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties ( meaning himself and mate ) and concluded by inviting stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux . \" he wants you to take a glass of wine with him ,\" said the interpreter . \" thank him heartily ; but tell him it \\' s against my principles to drink with the man i \\' ve diddled . in fact , tell him i must go .\" \" he says , monsieur , that his principles won \\' t admit of his drinking ; but that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink , then monsieur had best drop all four boats , and pull the ship away from these whales , for it \\' s so calm they won \\' t drift .\" by this time stubb was over the side , and getting into his boat , hailed the guernsey - man to this effect ,-- that having a long tow - line in his boat , he would do what he could to help them , by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship \\' s side . while the frenchman \\' s boats , then , were engaged in towing the ship one way , stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way , ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow - line . presently a breeze sprang up ; stubb feigned to cast off from the whale ; hoisting his boats , the frenchman soon increased his distance , while the pequod slid in between him and stubb \\' s whale . whereupon stubb quickly pulled to the floating body , and hailing the pequod to give notice of his intentions , at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning . seizing his sharp boat - spade , he commenced an excavation in the body , a little behind the side fin . you would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea ; and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs , it was like turning up old roman tiles and pottery buried in fat english loam . his boat \\' s crew were all in high excitement , eagerly helping their chief , and looking as anxious as gold - hunters . and all the time numberless fowls were diving , and ducking , and screaming , and yelling , and fighting around them . stubb was beginning to look disappointed , especially as the horrible nosegay increased , when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague , there stole a faint stream of perfume , which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it , as one river will flow into and then along with another , without at all blending with it for a time . \" i have it , i have it ,\" cried stubb , with delight , striking something in the subterranean regions , \" a purse ! a purse !\" dropping his spade , he thrust both hands in , and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe windsor soap , or rich mottled old cheese ; very unctuous and savory withal . you might easily dent it with your thumb ; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour . and this , good friends , is ambergris , worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist . some six handfuls were obtained ; but more was unavoidably lost in the sea , and still more , perhaps , might have been secured were it not for impatient ahab \\' s loud command to stubb to desist , and come on board , else the ship would bid them good bye . chapter 92 ambergris . now this ambergris is a very curious substance , and so important as an article of commerce , that in 1791 a certain nantucket - born captain coffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that subject . for at that time , and indeed until a comparatively late day , the precise origin of ambergris remained , like amber itself , a problem to the learned . though the word ambergris is but the french compound for grey amber , yet the two substances are quite distinct . for amber , though at times found on the sea - coast , is also dug up in some far inland soils , whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea . besides , amber is a hard , transparent , brittle , odorless substance , used for mouth - pieces to pipes , for beads and ornaments ; but ambergris is soft , waxy , and so highly fragrant and spicy , that it is largely used in perfumery , in pastiles , precious candles , hair - powders , and pomatum . the turks use it in cooking , and also carry it to mecca , for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to st . peter \\' s in rome . some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret , to flavor it . who would think , then , that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale ! yet so it is . by some , ambergris is supposed to be the cause , and by others the effect , of the dyspepsia in the whale . how to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say , unless by administering three or four boat loads of brandreth \\' s pills , and then running out of harm \\' s way , as laborers do in blasting rocks . i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris , certain hard , round , bony plates , which at first stubb thought might be sailors \\' trowsers buttons ; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner . now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay ; is this nothing ? bethink thee of that saying of st . paul in corinthians , about corruption and incorruption ; how that we are sown in dishonour , but raised in glory . and likewise call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk . also forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill - savor , cologne - water , in its rudimental manufacturing stages , is the worst . i should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal , but cannot , owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen , and which , in the estimation of some already biased minds , might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the frenchman \\' s two whales . elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved , that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly , untidy business . but there is another thing to rebut . they hint that all whales always smell bad . now how did this odious stigma originate ? i opine , that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the greenland whaling ships in london , more than two centuries ago . because those whalemen did not then , and do not now , try out their oil at sea as the southern ships have always done ; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits , thrust it through the bung holes of large casks , and carry it home in that manner ; the shortness of the season in those icy seas , and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed , forbidding any other course . the consequence is , that upon breaking into the hold , and unloading one of these whale cemeteries , in the greenland dock , a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave - yard , for the foundations of a lying - in - hospital . i partly surmise also , that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland , in former times , of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg , which latter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack , in his great work on smells , a text - book on that subject . as its name imports ( smeer , fat ; berg , to put up ), this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried out , without being taken home to holland for that purpose . it was a collection of furnaces , fat - kettles , and oil sheds ; and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor . but all this is quite different with a south sea sperm whaler ; which in a voyage of four years perhaps , after completely filling her hold with oil , does not , perhaps , consume fifty days in the business of boiling out ; and in the state that it is casked , the oil is nearly scentless . the truth is , that living or dead , if but decently treated , whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor ; nor can whalemen be recognised , as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a jew in the company , by the nose . nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant , when , as a general thing , he enjoys such high health ; taking abundance of exercise ; always out of doors ; though , it is true , seldom in the open air . i say , that the motion of a sperm whale \\' s flukes above water dispenses a perfume , as when a musk - scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor . what then shall i liken the sperm whale to for fragrance , considering his magnitude ? must it not be to that famous elephant , with jewelled tusks , and redolent with myrrh , which was led out of an indian town to do honour to alexander the great ? chapter 93 the castaway . it was but some few days after encountering the frenchman , that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the pequod \\' s crew ; an event most lamentable ; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own . now , in the whale ship , it is not every one that goes in the boats . some few hands are reserved called ship - keepers , whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale . as a general thing , these ship - keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats \\' crews . but if there happen to be an unduly slender , clumsy , or timorous wight in the ship , that wight is certain to be made a ship - keeper . it was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nick - name , pip by abbreviation . poor pip ! ye have heard of him before ; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight , so gloomy - jolly . in outer aspect , pip and dough - boy made a match , like a black pony and a white one , of equal developments , though of dissimilar colour , driven in one eccentric span . but while hapless dough - boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects , pip , though over tender - hearted , was at bottom very bright , with that pleasant , genial , jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe ; a tribe , which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer , freer relish than any other race . for blacks , the year \\' s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty - five fourth of julys and new year \\' s days . nor smile so , while i write that this little black was brilliant , for even blackness has its brilliancy ; behold yon lustrous ebony , panelled in king \\' s cabinets . but pip loved life , and all life \\' s peaceable securities ; so that the panic - striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped , had most sadly blurred his brightness ; though , as ere long will be seen , what was thus temporarily subdued in him , in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires , that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native tolland county in connecticut , he had once enlivened many a fiddler \\' s frolic on the green ; and at melodious even - tide , with his gay ha - ha ! had turned the round horizon into one star - belled tambourine . so , though in the clear air of day , suspended against a blue - veined neck , the pure - watered diamond drop will healthful glow ; yet , when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre , he lays it against a gloomy ground , and then lights it up , not by the sun , but by some unnatural gases . then come out those fiery effulgences , infernally superb ; then the evil - blazing diamond , once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies , looks like some crown - jewel stolen from the king of hell . but let us to the story . it came to pass , that in the ambergris affair stubb \\' s after - oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand , as for a time to become quite maimed ; and , temporarily , pip was put into his place . the first time stubb lowered with him , pip evinced much nervousness ; but happily , for that time , escaped close contact with the whale ; and therefore came off not altogether discreditably ; though stubb observing him , took care , afterwards , to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost , for he might often find it needful . now upon the second lowering , the boat paddled upon the whale ; and as the fish received the darted iron , it gave its customary rap , which happened , in this instance , to be right under poor pip \\' s seat . the involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap , paddle in hand , out of the boat ; and in such a way , that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest , he breasted it overboard with him , so as to become entangled in it , when at last plumping into the water . that instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run , the line swiftly straightened ; and presto ! poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat , remorselessly dragged there by the line , which had taken several turns around his chest and neck . tashtego stood in the bows . he was full of the fire of the hunt . he hated pip for a poltroon . snatching the boat - knife from its sheath , he suspended its sharp edge over the line , and turning towards stubb , exclaimed interrogatively , \" cut ?\" meantime pip \\' s blue , choked face plainly looked , do , for god \\' s sake ! all passed in a flash . in less than half a minute , this entire thing happened . \" damn him , cut !\" roared stubb ; and so the whale was lost and pip was saved . so soon as he recovered himself , the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew . tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate , stubb then in a plain , business - like , but still half humorous manner , cursed pip officially ; and that done , unofficially gave him much wholesome advice . the substance was , never jump from a boat , pip , except -- but all the rest was indefinite , as the soundest advice ever is . now , in general , stick to the boat , is your true motto in whaling ; but cases will sometimes happen when leap from the boat , is still better . moreover , as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip , he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future ; stubb suddenly dropped all advice , and concluded with a peremptory command , \" stick to the boat , pip , or by the lord , i won \\' t pick you up if you jump ; mind that . we can \\' t afford to lose whales by the likes of you ; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would , pip , in alabama . bear that in mind , and don \\' t jump any more .\" hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted , that though man loved his fellow , yet man is a money - making animal , which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence . but we are all in the hands of the gods ; and pip jumped again . it was under very similar circumstances to the first performance ; but this time he did not breast out the line ; and hence , when the whale started to run , pip was left behind on the sea , like a hurried traveller \\' s trunk . alas ! stubb was but too true to his word . it was a beautiful , bounteous , blue day ; the spangled sea calm and cool , and flatly stretching away , all round , to the horizon , like gold - beater \\' s skin hammered out to the extremest . bobbing up and down in that sea , pip \\' s ebon head showed like a head of cloves . no boat - knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern . stubb \\' s inexorable back was turned upon him ; and the whale was winged . in three minutes , a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between pip and stubb . out from the centre of the sea , poor pip turned his crisp , curling , black head to the sun , another lonely castaway , though the loftiest and the brightest . now , in calm weather , to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a spring - carriage ashore . but the awful lonesomeness is intolerable . the intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity , my god ! who can tell it ? mark , how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea -- mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides . but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate ? no ; he did not mean to , at least . because there were two boats in his wake , and he supposed , no doubt , that they would of course come up to pip very quickly , and pick him up ; though , indeed , such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity , is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances ; and such instances not unfrequently occur ; almost invariably in the fishery , a coward , so called , is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies . but it so happened , that those boats , without seeing pip , suddenly spying whales close to them on one side , turned , and gave chase ; and stubb \\' s boat was now so far away , and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish , that pip \\' s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably . by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him ; but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot ; such , at least , they said he was . the sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up , but drowned the infinite of his soul . not drowned entirely , though . rather carried down alive to wondrous depths , where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes ; and the miser - merman , wisdom , revealed his hoarded heaps ; and among the joyous , heartless , ever - juvenile eternities , pip saw the multitudinous , god - omnipresent , coral insects , that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs . he saw god \\' s foot upon the treadle of the loom , and spoke it ; and therefore his shipmates called him mad . so man \\' s insanity is heaven \\' s sense ; and wandering from all mortal reason , man comes at last to that celestial thought , which , to reason , is absurd and frantic ; and weal or woe , feels then uncompromised , indifferent as his god . for the rest , blame not stubb too hardly . the thing is common in that fishery ; and in the sequel of the narrative , it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself . chapter 94 a squeeze of the hand . that whale of stubb \\' s , so dearly purchased , was duly brought to the pequod \\' s side , where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed , were regularly gone through , even to the baling of the heidelburgh tun , or case . while some were occupied with this latter duty , others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs , so soon as filled with the sperm ; and when the proper time arrived , this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the try - works , of which anon . it had cooled and crystallized to such a degree , that when , with several others , i sat down before a large constantine \\' s bath of it , i found it strangely concreted into lumps , here and there rolling about in the liquid part . it was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid . a sweet and unctuous duty ! no wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic . such a clearer ! such a sweetener ! such a softener ! such a delicious molifier ! after having my hands in it for only a few minutes , my fingers felt like eels , and began , as it were , to serpentine and spiralise . as i sat there at my ease , cross - legged on the deck ; after the bitter exertion at the windlass ; under a blue tranquil sky ; the ship under indolent sail , and gliding so serenely along ; as i bathed my hands among those soft , gentle globules of infiltrated tissues , woven almost within the hour ; as they richly broke to my fingers , and discharged all their opulence , like fully ripe grapes their wine ; as i snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma ,-- literally and truly , like the smell of spring violets ; i declare to you , that for the time i lived as in a musky meadow ; i forgot all about our horrible oath ; in that inexpressible sperm , i washed my hands and my heart of it ; i almost began to credit the old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger ; while bathing in that bath , i felt divinely free from all ill - will , or petulance , or malice , of any sort whatsoever . squeeze ! squeeze ! squeeze ! all the morning long ; i squeezed that sperm till i myself almost melted into it ; i squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me ; and i found myself unwittingly squeezing my co - laborers \\' hands in it , mistaking their hands for the gentle globules . such an abounding , affectionate , friendly , loving feeling did this avocation beget ; that at last i was continually squeezing their hands , and looking up into their eyes sentimentally ; as much as to say ,-- oh ! my dear fellow beings , why should we longer cherish any social acerbities , or know the slightest ill - humor or envy ! come ; let us squeeze hands all round ; nay , let us all squeeze ourselves into each other ; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness . would that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever ! for now , since by many prolonged , repeated experiences , i have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower , or at least shift , his conceit of attainable felicity ; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy ; but in the wife , the heart , the bed , the table , the saddle , the fireside , the country ; now that i have perceived all this , i am ready to squeeze case eternally . in thoughts of the visions of the night , i saw long rows of angels in paradise , each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti . now , while discoursing of sperm , it behooves to speak of other things akin to it , in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try - works . first comes white - horse , so called , which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish , and also from the thicker portions of his flukes . it is tough with congealed tendons -- a wad of muscle -- but still contains some oil . after being severed from the whale , the white - horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer . they look much like blocks of berkshire marble . plum - pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whale \\' s flesh , here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber , and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness . it is a most refreshing , convivial , beautiful object to behold . as its name imports , it is of an exceedingly rich , mottled tint , with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground , dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple . it is plums of rubies , in pictures of citron . spite of reason , it is hard to keep yourself from eating it . i confess , that once i stole behind the foremast to try it . it tasted something as i should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might have tasted , supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season , and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of champagne . there is another substance , and a very singular one , which turns up in the course of this business , but which i feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe . it is called slobgollion ; an appellation original with the whalemen , and even so is the nature of the substance . it is an ineffably oozy , stringy affair , most frequently found in the tubs of sperm , after a prolonged squeezing , and subsequent decanting . i hold it to be the wondrously thin , ruptured membranes of the case , coalescing . gurry , so called , is a term properly belonging to right whalemen , but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen . it designates the dark , glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the greenland or right whale , and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble leviathan . nippers . strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale \\' s vocabulary . but as applied by whalemen , it becomes so . a whaleman \\' s nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of leviathan \\' s tail : it averages an inch in thickness , and for the rest , is about the size of the iron part of a hoe . edgewise moved along the oily deck , it operates like a leathern squilgee ; and by nameless blandishments , as of magic , allures along with it all impurities . but to learn all about these recondite matters , your best way is at once to descend into the blubber - room , and have a long talk with its inmates . this place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket - pieces , when stript and hoisted from the whale . when the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents , this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros , especially by night . on one side , lit by a dull lantern , a space has been left clear for the workmen . they generally go in pairs ,-- a pike - and - gaffman and a spade - man . the whaling - pike is similar to a frigate \\' s boarding - weapon of the same name . the gaff is something like a boat - hook . with his gaff , the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber , and strives to hold it from slipping , as the ship pitches and lurches about . meanwhile , the spade - man stands on the sheet itself , perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse - pieces . this spade is sharp as hone can make it ; the spademan \\' s feet are shoeless ; the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him , like a sledge . if he cuts off one of his own toes , or one of his assistants \\', would you be very much astonished ? toes are scarce among veteran blubber - room men . chapter 95 the cassock . had you stepped on board the pequod at a certain juncture of this post - mortemizing of the whale ; and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass , pretty sure am i that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange , enigmatical object , which you would have seen there , lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers . not the wondrous cistern in the whale \\' s huge head ; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw ; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail ; none of these would so surprise you , as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone ,-- longer than a kentuckian is tall , nigh a foot in diameter at the base , and jet - black as yojo , the ebony idol of queequeg . and an idol , indeed , it is ; or , rather , in old times , its likeness was . such an idol as that found in the secret groves of queen maachah in judea ; and for worshipping which , king asa , her son , did depose her , and destroyed the idol , and burnt it for an abomination at the brook kedron , as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the first book of kings . look at the sailor , called the mincer , who now comes along , and assisted by two allies , heavily backs the grandissimus , as the mariners call it , and with bowed shoulders , staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field . extending it upon the forecastle deck , he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt , as an african hunter the pelt of a boa . this done he turns the pelt inside out , like a pantaloon leg ; gives it a good stretching , so as almost to double its diameter ; and at last hangs it , well spread , in the rigging , to dry . ere long , it is taken down ; when removing some three feet of it , towards the pointed extremity , and then cutting two slits for arm - holes at the other end , he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it . the mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling . immemorial to all his order , this investiture alone will adequately protect him , while employed in the peculiar functions of his office . that office consists in mincing the horse - pieces of blubber for the pots ; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse , planted endwise against the bulwarks , and with a capacious tub beneath it , into which the minced pieces drop , fast as the sheets from a rapt orator \\' s desk . arrayed in decent black ; occupying a conspicuous pulpit ; intent on bible leaves ; what a candidate for an archbishopric , what a lad for a pope were this mincer !* * bible leaves ! bible leaves ! this is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer . it enjoins him to be careful , and cut his work into as thin slices as possible , inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated , and its quantity considerably increased , besides perhaps improving it in quality . chapter 96 the try - works . besides her hoisted boats , an american whaler is outwardly distinguished by her try - works . she presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship . it is as if from the open field a brick - kiln were transported to her planks . the try - works are planted between the foremast and mainmast , the most roomy part of the deck . the timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength , fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar , some ten feet by eight square , and five in height . the foundation does not penetrate the deck , but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides , and screwing it down to the timbers . on the flanks it is cased with wood , and at top completely covered by a large , sloping , battened hatchway . removing this hatch we expose the great try - pots , two in number , and each of several barrels \\' capacity . when not in use , they are kept remarkably clean . sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand , till they shine within like silver punch - bowls . during the night - watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap . while employed in polishing them -- one man in each pot , side by side -- many confidential communications are carried on , over the iron lips . it is a place also for profound mathematical meditation . it was in the left hand try - pot of the pequod , with the soapstone diligently circling round me , that i was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact , that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid , my soapstone for example , will descend from any point in precisely the same time . removing the fire - board from the front of the try - works , the bare masonry of that side is exposed , penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces , directly underneath the pots . these mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron . the intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck , by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works . by a tunnel inserted at the rear , this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates . there are no external chimneys ; they open direct from the rear wall . and here let us go back for a moment . it was about nine o \\' clock at night that the pequod \\' s try - works were first started on this present voyage . it belonged to stubb to oversee the business . \" all ready there ? off hatch , then , and start her . you cook , fire the works .\" this was an easy thing , for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage . here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try - works has to be fed for a time with wood . after that no wood is used , except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel . in a word , after being tried out , the crisp , shrivelled blubber , now called scraps or fritters , still contains considerable of its unctuous properties . these fritters feed the flames . like a plethoric burning martyr , or a self - consuming misanthrope , once ignited , the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body . would that he consumed his own smoke ! for his smoke is horrible to inhale , and inhale it you must , and not only that , but you must live in it for the time . it has an unspeakable , wild , hindoo odor about it , such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres . it smells like the left wing of the day of judgment ; it is an argument for the pit . by midnight the works were in full operation . we were clear from the carcase ; sail had been made ; the wind was freshening ; the wild ocean darkness was intense . but that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames , which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues , and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging , as with the famed greek fire . the burning ship drove on , as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed . so the pitch and sulphur - freighted brigs of the bold hydriote , canaris , issuing from their midnight harbors , with broad sheets of flame for sails , bore down upon the turkish frigates , and folded them in conflagrations . the hatch , removed from the top of the works , now afforded a wide hearth in front of them . standing on this were the tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers , always the whale - ship \\' s stokers . with huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots , or stirred up the fires beneath , till the snaky flames darted , curling , out of the doors to catch them by the feet . the smoke rolled away in sullen heaps . to every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil , which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces . opposite the mouth of the works , on the further side of the wide wooden hearth , was the windlass . this served for a sea - sofa . here lounged the watch , when not otherwise employed , looking into the red heat of the fire , till their eyes felt scorched in their heads . their tawny features , now all begrimed with smoke and sweat , their matted beards , and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth , all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works . as they narrated to each other their unholy adventures , their tales of terror told in words of mirth ; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them , like the flames from the furnace ; as to and fro , in their front , the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers ; as the wind howled on , and the sea leaped , and the ship groaned and dived , and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night , and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth , and viciously spat round her on all sides ; then the rushing pequod , freighted with savages , and laden with fire , and burning a corpse , and plunging into that blackness of darkness , seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander \\' s soul . so seemed it to me , as i stood at her helm , and for long hours silently guided the way of this fire - ship on the sea . wrapped , for that interval , in darkness myself , i but the better saw the redness , the madness , the ghastliness of others . the continual sight of the fiend shapes before me , capering half in smoke and half in fire , these at last begat kindred visions in my soul , so soon as i began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm . but that night , in particular , a strange ( and ever since inexplicable ) thing occurred to me . starting from a brief standing sleep , i was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong . the jaw - bone tiller smote my side , which leaned against it ; in my ears was the low hum of sails , just beginning to shake in the wind ; i thought my eyes were open ; i was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart . but , spite of all this , i could see no compass before me to steer by ; though it seemed but a minute since i had been watching the card , by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it . nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom , now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness . uppermost was the impression , that whatever swift , rushing thing i stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern . a stark , bewildered feeling , as of death , came over me . convulsively my hands grasped the tiller , but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was , somehow , in some enchanted way , inverted . my god ! what is the matter with me ? thought i . lo ! in my brief sleep i had turned myself about , and was fronting the ship \\' s stern , with my back to her prow and the compass . in an instant i faced back , just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind , and very probably capsizing her . how glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night , and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee ! look not too long in the face of the fire , o man ! never dream with thy hand on the helm ! turn not thy back to the compass ; accept the first hint of the hitching tiller ; believe not the artificial fire , when its redness makes all things look ghastly . to - morrow , in the natural sun , the skies will be bright ; those who glared like devils in the forking flames , the morn will show in far other , at least gentler , relief ; the glorious , golden , glad sun , the only true lamp -- all others but liars ! nevertheless the sun hides not virginia \\' s dismal swamp , nor rome \\' s accursed campagna , nor wide sahara , nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon . the sun hides not the ocean , which is the dark side of this earth , and which is two thirds of this earth . so , therefore , that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him , that mortal man cannot be true -- not true , or undeveloped . with books the same . the truest of all men was the man of sorrows , and the truest of all books is solomon \\' s , and ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe . \" all is vanity .\" all . this wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian solomon \\' s wisdom yet . but he who dodges hospitals and jails , and walks fast crossing graveyards , and would rather talk of operas than hell ; calls cowper , young , pascal , rousseau , poor devils all of sick men ; and throughout a care - free lifetime swears by rabelais as passing wise , and therefore jolly ;-- not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb - stones , and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous solomon . but even solomon , he says , \" the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain \" ( i . e ., even while living ) \" in the congregation of the dead .\" give not thyself up , then , to fire , lest it invert thee , deaden thee ; as for the time it did me . there is a wisdom that is woe ; but there is a woe that is madness . and there is a catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges , and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces . and even if he for ever flies within the gorge , that gorge is in the mountains ; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain , even though they soar . chapter 97 the lamp . had you descended from the pequod \\' s try - works to the pequod \\' s forecastle , where the off duty watch were sleeping , for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors . there they lay in their triangular oaken vaults , each mariner a chiselled muteness ; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes . in merchantmen , oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens . to dress in the dark , and eat in the dark , and stumble in darkness to his pallet , this is his usual lot . but the whaleman , as he seeks the food of light , so he lives in light . he makes his berth an aladdin \\' s lamp , and lays him down in it ; so that in the pitchiest night the ship \\' s black hull still houses an illumination . see with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps -- often but old bottles and vials , though -- to the copper cooler at the try - works , and replenishes them there , as mugs of ale at a vat . he burns , too , the purest of oil , in its unmanufactured , and , therefore , unvitiated state ; a fluid unknown to solar , lunar , or astral contrivances ashore . it is sweet as early grass butter in april . he goes and hunts for his oil , so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness , even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game . chapter 98 stowing down and clearing up . already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from the mast - head ; how he is chased over the watery moors , and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep ; how he is then towed alongside and beheaded ; and how ( on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed ) his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner ; how , in due time , he is condemned to the pots , and , like shadrach , meshach , and abednego , his spermaceti , oil , and bone pass unscathed through the fire ;-- but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsing -- singing , if i may -- the romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold , where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities , sliding along beneath the surface as before ; but , alas ! never more to rise and blow . while still warm , the oil , like hot punch , is received into the six - barrel casks ; and while , perhaps , the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea , the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over , end for end , and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck , like so many land slides , till at last man - handled and stayed in their course ; and all round the hoops , rap , rap , go as many hammers as can play upon them , for now , ex officio , every sailor is a cooper . at length , when the last pint is casked , and all is cool , then the great hatchways are unsealed , the bowels of the ship are thrown open , and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea . this done , the hatches are replaced , and hermetically closed , like a closet walled up . in the sperm fishery , this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in all the business of whaling . one day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil ; on the sacred quarter - deck enormous masses of the whale \\' s head are profanely piled ; great rusty casks lie about , as in a brewery yard ; the smoke from the try - works has besooted all the bulwarks ; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness ; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself ; while on all hands the din is deafening . but a day or two after , you look about you , and prick your ears in this self - same ship ; and were it not for the tell - tale boats and try - works , you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel , with a most scrupulously neat commander . the unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue . this is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil . besides , from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale , a potent lye is readily made ; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side , that lye quickly exterminates it . hands go diligently along the bulwarks , and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness . the soot is brushed from the lower rigging . all the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away . the great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try - works , completely hiding the pots ; every cask is out of sight ; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks ; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship \\' s company , the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded , then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions ; shift themselves from top to toe ; and finally issue to the immaculate deck , fresh and all aglow , as bridegrooms new - leaped from out the daintiest holland . now , with elated step , they pace the planks in twos and threes , and humorously discourse of parlors , sofas , carpets , and fine cambrics ; propose to mat the deck ; think of having hanging to the top ; object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle . to hint to such musked mariners of oil , and bone , and blubber , were little short of audacity . they know not the thing you distantly allude to . away , and bring us napkins ! but mark : aloft there , at the three mast heads , stand three men intent on spying out more whales , which , if caught , infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture , and drop at least one small grease - spot somewhere . yes ; and many is the time , when , after the severest uninterrupted labors , which know no night ; continuing straight through for ninety - six hours ; when from the boat , where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the line ,-- they only step to the deck to carry vast chains , and heave the heavy windlass , and cut and slash , yea , and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try - works ; when , on the heel of all this , they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship , and make a spotless dairy room of it ; many is the time the poor fellows , just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks , are startled by the cry of \" there she blows !\" and away they fly to fight another whale , and go through the whole weary thing again . oh ! my friends , but this is man - killing ! yet this is life . for hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from this world \\' s vast bulk its small but valuable sperm ; and then , with weary patience , cleansed ourselves from its defilements , and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul ; hardly is this done , when -- there she blows !-- the ghost is spouted up , and away we sail to fight some other world , and go through young life \\' s old routine again . oh ! the metempsychosis ! oh ! pythagoras , that in bright greece , two thousand years ago , did die , so good , so wise , so mild ; i sailed with thee along the peruvian coast last voyage -- and , foolish as i am , taught thee , a green simple boy , how to splice a rope ! chapter 99 the doubloon . ere now it has been related how ahab was wont to pace his quarter - deck , taking regular turns at either limit , the binnacle and mainmast ; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks , when most plunged in his mood , he was wont to pause in turn at each spot , and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him . when he halted before the binnacle , with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass , that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose ; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast , then , as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there , he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness , only dashed with a certain wild longing , if not hopefulness . but one morning , turning to pass the doubloon , he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it , as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them . and some certain significance lurks in all things , else all things are little worth , and the round world itself but an empty cipher , except to sell by the cartload , as they do hills about boston , to fill up some morass in the milky way . now this doubloon was of purest , virgin gold , raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills , whence , east and west , over golden sands , the head - waters of many a pactolus flows . and though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes , yet , untouchable and immaculate to any foulness , it still preserved its quito glow . nor , though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands , and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach , nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last . for it was set apart and sanctified to one awe - striking end ; and however wanton in their sailor ways , one and all , the mariners revered it as the white whale \\' s talisman . sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night , wondering whose it was to be at last , and whether he would ever live to spend it . now those noble golden coins of south america are as medals of the sun and tropic token - pieces . here palms , alpacas , and volcanoes ; sun \\' s disks and stars ; ecliptics , horns - of - plenty , and rich banners waving , are in luxuriant profusion stamped ; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories , by passing through those fancy mints , so spanishly poetic . it so chanced that the doubloon of the pequod was a most wealthy example of these things . on its round border it bore the letters , republica del ecuador : quito . so this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world , and beneath the great equator , and named after it ; and it had been cast midway up the andes , in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn . zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three andes \\' summits ; from one a flame ; a tower on another ; on the third a crowing cock ; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac , the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics , and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at libra . before this equatorial coin , ahab , not unobserved by others , was now pausing . \" there \\' s something ever egotistical in mountain - tops and towers , and all other grand and lofty things ; look here ,-- three peaks as proud as lucifer . the firm tower , that is ahab ; the volcano , that is ahab ; the courageous , the undaunted , and victorious fowl , that , too , is ahab ; all are ahab ; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe , which , like a magician \\' s glass , to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self . great pains , small gains for those who ask the world to solve them ; it cannot solve itself . methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face ; but see ! aye , he enters the sign of storms , the equinox ! and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at aries ! from storm to storm ! so be it , then . born in throes , \\' t is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs ! so be it , then ! here \\' s stout stuff for woe to work on . so be it , then .\" \" no fairy fingers can have pressed the gold , but devil \\' s claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday ,\" murmured starbuck to himself , leaning against the bulwarks . \" the old man seems to read belshazzar \\' s awful writing . i have never marked the coin inspectingly . he goes below ; let me read . a dark valley between three mighty , heaven - abiding peaks , that almost seem the trinity , in some faint earthly symbol . so in this vale of death , god girds us round ; and over all our gloom , the sun of righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope . if we bend down our eyes , the dark vale shows her mouldy soil ; but if we lift them , the bright sun meets our glance half way , to cheer . yet , oh , the great sun is no fixture ; and if , at midnight , we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him , we gaze for him in vain ! this coin speaks wisely , mildly , truly , but still sadly to me . i will quit it , lest truth shake me falsely .\" \" there now \\' s the old mogul ,\" soliloquized stubb by the try - works , \" he \\' s been twigging it ; and there goes starbuck from the same , and both with faces which i should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long . and all from looking at a piece of gold , which did i have it now on negro hill or in corlaer \\' s hook , i \\' d not look at it very long ere spending it . humph ! in my poor , insignificant opinion , i regard this as queer . i have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings ; your doubloons of old spain , your doubloons of peru , your doubloons of chili , your doubloons of bolivia , your doubloons of popayan ; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles , and joes , and half joes , and quarter joes . what then should there be in this doubloon of the equator that is so killing wonderful ? by golconda ! let me read it once . halloa ! here \\' s signs and wonders truly ! that , now , is what old bowditch in his epitome calls the zodiac , and what my almanac below calls ditto . i \\' ll get the almanac and as i have heard devils can be raised with daboll \\' s arithmetic , i \\' ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the massachusetts calendar . here \\' s the book . let \\' s see now . signs and wonders ; and the sun , he \\' s always among \\' em . hem , hem , hem ; here they are -- here they go -- all alive :-- aries , or the ram ; taurus , or the bull and jimimi ! here \\' s gemini himself , or the twins . well ; the sun he wheels among \\' em . aye , here on the coin he \\' s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting - rooms all in a ring . book ! you lie there ; the fact is , you books must know your places . you \\' ll do to give us the bare words and facts , but we come in to supply the thoughts . that \\' s my small experience , so far as the massachusetts calendar , and bowditch \\' s navigator , and daboll \\' s arithmetic go . signs and wonders , eh ? pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs , and significant in wonders ! there \\' s a clue somewhere ; wait a bit ; hist -- hark ! by jove , i have it ! look you , doubloon , your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter ; and now i \\' ll read it off , straight out of the book . come , almanack ! to begin : there \\' s aries , or the ram -- lecherous dog , he begets us ; then , taurus , or the bull -- he bumps us the first thing ; then gemini , or the twins -- that is , virtue and vice ; we try to reach virtue , when lo ! comes cancer the crab , and drags us back ; and here , going from virtue , leo , a roaring lion , lies in the path -- he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw ;

and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar \\' s surcoat . \" hast seen the white whale !\" \" see you this ?\" and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it , he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone , terminating in a wooden head like a mallet . \" man my boat !\" cried ahab , impetuously , and tossing about the oars near him --\" stand by to lower !\" in less than a minute , without quitting his little craft , he and his crew were dropped to the water , and were soon alongside of the stranger . but here a curious difficulty presented itself . in the excitement of the moment , ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own , and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the pequod , and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment \\' s warning . now , it is no very easy matter for anybody -- except those who are almost hourly used to it , like whalemen -- to clamber up a ship \\' s side from a boat on the open sea ; for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks , and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson . so , deprived of one leg , and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention , ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again ; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain . it has before been hinted , perhaps , that every little untoward circumstance that befell him , and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap , almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab . and in the present instance , all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship , leaning over the side , by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there , and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully - ornamented man - ropes ; for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one - legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters . but this awkwardness only lasted a minute , because the strange captain , observing at a glance how affairs stood , cried out , \" i see , i see !-- avast heaving there ! jump , boys , and swing over the cutting - tackle .\" as good luck would have it , they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous , and the great tackles were still aloft , and the massive curved blubber - hook , now clean and dry , was still attached to the end . this was quickly lowered to ahab , who at once comprehending it all , slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook ( it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor , or the crotch of an apple tree ), and then giving the word , held himself fast , and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight , by pulling hand - over - hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle . soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks , and gently landed upon the capstan head . with his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome , the other captain advanced , and ahab , putting out his ivory leg , and crossing the ivory arm ( like two sword - fish blades ) cried out in his walrus way , \" aye , aye , hearty ! let us shake bones together !-- an arm and a leg !-- an arm that never can shrink , d \\' ye see ; and a leg that never can run . where did \\' st thou see the white whale ?-- how long ago ?\" \" the white whale ,\" said the englishman , pointing his ivory arm towards the east , and taking a rueful sight along it , as if it had been a telescope ; \" there i saw him , on the line , last season .\" \" and he took that arm off , did he ?\" asked ahab , now sliding down from the capstan , and resting on the englishman \\' s shoulder , as he did so . \" aye , he was the cause of it , at least ; and that leg , too ?\" \" spin me the yarn ,\" said ahab ; \" how was it ?\" \" it was the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line ,\" began the englishman . \" i was ignorant of the white whale at that time . well , one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales , and my boat fastened to one of them ; a regular circus horse he was , too , that went milling and milling round so , that my boat \\' s crew could only trim dish , by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale . presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale , with a milky - white head and hump , all crows \\' feet and wrinkles .\" \" it was he , it was he !\" cried ahab , suddenly letting out his suspended breath . \" and harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin .\" \" aye , aye -- they were mine -- my irons ,\" cried ahab , exultingly --\" but on !\" \" give me a chance , then ,\" said the englishman , good - humoredly . \" well , this old great - grandfather , with the white head and hump , runs all afoam into the pod , and goes to snapping furiously at my fast - line ! \" aye , i see !-- wanted to part it ; free the fast - fish -- an old trick -- i know him .\" \" how it was exactly ,\" continued the one - armed commander , \" i do not know ; but in biting the line , it got foul of his teeth , caught there somehow ; but we didn \\' t know it then ; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line , bounce we came plump on to his hump ! instead of the other whale \\' s ; that went off to windward , all fluking . seeing how matters stood , and what a noble great whale it was -- the noblest and biggest i ever saw , sir , in my life -- i resolved to capture him , spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in . and thinking the hap - hazard line would get loose , or the tooth it was tangled to might draw ( for i have a devil of a boat \\' s crew for a pull on a whale - line ); seeing all this , i say , i jumped into my first mate \\' s boat -- mr . mounttop \\' s here ( by the way , captain -- mounttop ; mounttop -- the captain );-- as i was saying , i jumped into mounttop \\' s boat , which , d \\' ye see , was gunwale and gunwale with mine , then ; and snatching the first harpoon , let this old great - grandfather have it . but , lord , look you , sir -- hearts and souls alive , man -- the next instant , in a jiff , i was blind as a bat -- both eyes out -- all befogged and bedeadened with black foam -- the whale \\' s tail looming straight up out of it , perpendicular in the air , like a marble steeple . no use sterning all , then ; but as i was groping at midday , with a blinding sun , all crown - jewels ; as i was groping , i say , after the second iron , to toss it overboard -- down comes the tail like a lima tower , cutting my boat in two , leaving each half in splinters ; and , flukes first , the white hump backed through the wreck , as though it was all chips . we all struck out . to escape his terrible flailings , i seized hold of my harpoon - pole sticking in him , and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish . but a combing sea dashed me off , and at the same instant , the fish , taking one good dart forwards , went down like a flash ; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here \" ( clapping his hand just below his shoulder ); \" yes , caught me just here , i say , and bore me down to hell \\' s flames , i was thinking ; when , when , all of a sudden , thank the good god , the barb ript its way along the flesh -- clear along the whole length of my arm -- came out nigh my wrist , and up i floated ;-- and that gentleman there will tell you the rest ( by the way , captain -- dr . bunger , ship \\' s surgeon : bunger , my lad ,-- the captain ). now , bunger boy , spin your part of the yarn .\" the professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out , had been all the time standing near them , with nothing specific visible , to denote his gentlemanly rank on board . his face was an exceedingly round but sober one ; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt , and patched trowsers ; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand , and a pill - box held in the other , occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains . but , at his superior \\' s introduction of him to ahab , he politely bowed , and straightway went on to do his captain \\' s bidding . \" it was a shocking bad wound ,\" began the whale - surgeon ; \" and , taking my advice , captain boomer here , stood our old sammy --\" \" samuel enderby is the name of my ship ,\" interrupted the one - armed captain , addressing ahab ; \" go on , boy .\" \" stood our old sammy off to the northward , to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the line . but it was no use -- i did all i could ; sat up with him nights ; was very severe with him in the matter of diet --\" \" oh , very severe !\" chimed in the patient himself ; then suddenly altering his voice , \" drinking hot rum toddies with me every night , till he couldn \\' t see to put on the bandages ; and sending me to bed , half seas over , about three o \\' clock in the morning . oh , ye stars ! he sat up with me indeed , and was very severe in my diet . oh ! a great watcher , and very dietetically severe , is dr . bunger . ( bunger , you dog , laugh out ! why don \\' t ye ? you know you \\' re a precious jolly rascal .) but , heave ahead , boy , i \\' d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man .\" \" my captain , you must have ere this perceived , respected sir \"-- said the imperturbable godly - looking bunger , slightly bowing to ahab --\" is apt to be facetious at times ; he spins us many clever things of that sort . but i may as well say -- en passant , as the french remark -- that i myself -- that is to say , jack bunger , late of the reverend clergy -- am a strict total abstinence man ; i never drink --\" \" water !\" cried the captain ; \" he never drinks it ; it \\' s a sort of fits to him ; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia ; but go on -- go on with the arm story .\" \" yes , i may as well ,\" said the surgeon , coolly . \" i was about observing , sir , before captain boomer \\' s facetious interruption , that spite of my best and severest endeavors , the wound kept getting worse and worse ; the truth was , sir , it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw ; more than two feet and several inches long . i measured it with the lead line . in short , it grew black ; i knew what was threatened , and off it came . but i had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there ; that thing is against all rule \"-- pointing at it with the marlingspike --\" that is the captain \\' s work , not mine ; he ordered the carpenter to make it ; he had that club - hammer there put to the end , to knock some one \\' s brains out with , i suppose , as he tried mine once . he flies into diabolical passions sometimes . do ye see this dent , sir \"-- removing his hat , and brushing aside his hair , and exposing a bowl - like cavity in his skull , but which bore not the slightest scarry trace , or any token of ever having been a wound --\" well , the captain there will tell you how that came here ; he knows .\" \" no , i don \\' t ,\" said the captain , \" but his mother did ; he was born with it . oh , you solemn rogue , you -- you bunger ! was there ever such another bunger in the watery world ? bunger , when you die , you ought to die in pickle , you dog ; you should be preserved to future ages , you rascal .\" \" what became of the white whale ?\" now cried ahab , who thus far had been impatiently listening to this by - play between the two englishmen . \" oh !\" cried the one - armed captain , \" oh , yes ! well ; after he sounded , we didn \\' t see him again for some time ; in fact , as i before hinted , i didn \\' t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick , till some time afterwards , when coming back to the line , we heard about moby dick -- as some call him -- and then i knew it was he .\" \" did \\' st thou cross his wake again ?\" \" twice .\" \" but could not fasten ?\" \" didn \\' t want to try to : ain \\' t one limb enough ? what should i do without this other arm ? and i \\' m thinking moby dick doesn \\' t bite so much as he swallows .\" \" well , then ,\" interrupted bunger , \" give him your left arm for bait to get the right . do you know , gentlemen \"-- very gravely and mathematically bowing to each captain in succession --\" do you know , gentlemen , that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine providence , that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a man \\' s arm ? and he knows it too . so that what you take for the white whale \\' s malice is only his awkwardness . for he never means to swallow a single limb ; he only thinks to terrify by feints . but sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow , formerly a patient of mine in ceylon , that making believe swallow jack - knives , once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest , and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more ; when i gave him an emetic , and he heaved it up in small tacks , d \\' ye see . no possible way for him to digest that jack - knife , and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system . yes , captain boomer , if you are quick enough about it , and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other , why in that case the arm is yours ; only let the whale have another chance at you shortly , that \\' s all .\" \" no , thank ye , bunger ,\" said the english captain , \" he \\' s welcome to the arm he has , since i can \\' t help it , and didn \\' t know him then ; but not to another one . no more white whales for me ; i \\' ve lowered for him once , and that has satisfied me . there would be great glory in killing him , i know that ; and there is a ship - load of precious sperm in him , but , hark ye , he \\' s best let alone ; don \\' t you think so , captain ?\"-- glancing at the ivory leg . \" he is . but he will still be hunted , for all that . what is best let alone , that accursed thing is not always what least allures . he \\' s all a magnet ! how long since thou saw \\' st him last ? which way heading ?\" \" bless my soul , and curse the foul fiend \\' s ,\" cried bunger , stoopingly walking round ahab , and like a dog , strangely snuffing ; \" this man \\' s blood -- bring the thermometer !-- it \\' s at the boiling point !-- his pulse makes these planks beat !-- sir !\"-- taking a lancet from his pocket , and drawing near to ahab \\' s arm . \" avast !\" roared ahab , dashing him against the bulwarks --\" man the boat ! which way heading ?\" \" good god !\" cried the english captain , to whom the question was put . \" what \\' s the matter ? he was heading east , i think .-- is your captain crazy ?\" whispering fedallah . but fedallah , putting a finger on his lip , slid over the bulwarks to take the boat \\' s steering oar , and ahab , swinging the cutting - tackle towards him , commanded the ship \\' s sailors to stand by to lower . in a moment he was standing in the boat \\' s stern , and the manilla men were springing to their oars . in vain the english captain hailed him . with back to the stranger ship , and face set like a flint to his own , ahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod . chapter 101 the decanter . ere the english ship fades from sight , be it set down here , that she hailed from london , and was named after the late samuel enderby , merchant of that city , the original of the famous whaling house of enderby & sons ; a house which in my poor whaleman \\' s opinion , comes not far behind the united royal houses of the tudors and bourbons , in point of real historical interest . how long , prior to the year of our lord 1775 , this great whaling house was in existence , my numerous fish - documents do not make plain ; but in that year ( 1775 ) it fitted out the first english ships that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale ; though for some score of years previous ( ever since 1726 ) our valiant coffins and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large fleets pursued that leviathan , but only in the north and south atlantic : not elsewhere . be it distinctly recorded here , that the nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm whale ; and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him . in 1778 , a fine ship , the amelia , fitted out for the express purpose , and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys , boldly rounded cape horn , and was the first among the nations to lower a whale - boat of any sort in the great south sea . the voyage was a skilful and lucky one ; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm , the amelia \\' s example was soon followed by other ships , english and american , and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the pacific were thrown open . but not content with this good deed , the indefatigable house again bestirred itself : samuel and all his sons -- how many , their mother only knows -- and under their immediate auspices , and partly , i think , at their expense , the british government was induced to send the sloop - of - war rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea . commanded by a naval post - captain , the rattler made a rattling voyage of it , and did some service ; how much does not appear . but this is not all . in 1819 , the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own , to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japan . that ship -- well called the \" syren \"-- made a noble experimental cruise ; and it was thus that the great japanese whaling ground first became generally known . the syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a captain coffin , a nantucketer . all honour to the enderbies , therefore , whose house , i think , exists to the present day ; though doubtless the original samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world . the ship named after him was worthy of the honour , being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way . i boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the patagonian coast , and drank good flip down in the forecastle . it was a fine gam we had , and they were all trumps -- every soul on board . a short life to them , and a jolly death . and that fine gam i had -- long , very long after old ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel -- it minds me of the noble , solid , saxon hospitality of that ship ; and may my parson forget me , and the devil remember me , if i ever lose sight of it . flip ? did i say we had flip ? yes , and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour ; and when the squall came ( for it \\' s squally off there by patagonia ), and all hands -- visitors and all -- were called to reef topsails , we were so top - heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines ; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails , so that we hung there , reefed fast in the howling gale , a warning example to all drunken tars . however , the masts did not go overboard ; and by and by we scrambled down , so sober , that we had to pass the flip again , though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle , rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste . the beef was fine -- tough , but with body in it . they said it was bull - beef ; others , that it was dromedary beef ; but i do not know , for certain , how that was . they had dumplings too ; small , but substantial , symmetrically globular , and indestructible dumplings . i fancied that you could feel them , and roll them about in you after they were swallowed . if you stooped over too far forward , you risked their pitching out of you like billiard - balls . the bread -- but that couldn \\' t be helped ; besides , it was an anti - scorbutic ; in short , the bread contained the only fresh fare they had . but the forecastle was not very light , and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it . but all in all , taking her from truck to helm , considering the dimensions of the cook \\' s boilers , including his own live parchment boilers ; fore and aft , i say , the samuel enderby was a jolly ship ; of good fare and plenty ; fine flip and strong ; crack fellows all , and capital from boot heels to hat - band . but why was it , think ye , that the samuel enderby , and some other english whalers i know of -- not all though -- were such famous , hospitable ships ; that passed round the beef , and the bread , and the can , and the joke ; and were not soon weary of eating , and drinking , and laughing ? i will tell you . the abounding good cheer of these english whalers is matter for historical research . nor have i been at all sparing of historical whale research , when it has seemed needed . the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollanders , zealanders , and danes ; from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery ; and what is yet more , their fat old fashions , touching plenty to eat and drink . for , as a general thing , the english merchant - ship scrimps her crew ; but not so the english whaler . hence , in the english , this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural , but incidental and particular ; and , therefore , must have some special origin , which is here pointed out , and will be still further elucidated . during my researches in the leviathanic histories , i stumbled upon an ancient dutch volume , which , by the musty whaling smell of it , i knew must be about whalers . the title was , \" dan coopman ,\" wherefore i concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdam cooper in the fishery , as every whale ship must carry its cooper . i was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one \" fitz swackhammer .\" but my friend dr . snodhead , a very learned man , professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus and st . pott \\' s , to whom i handed the work for translation , giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble -- this same dr . snodhead , so soon as he spied the book , assured me that \" dan coopman \" did not mean \" the cooper ,\" but \" the merchant .\" in short , this ancient and learned low dutch book treated of the commerce of holland ; and , among other subjects , contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery . and in this chapter it was , headed , \" smeer ,\" or \" fat ,\" that i found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of dutch whalemen ; from which list , as translated by dr . snodhead , i transcribe the following : 400 , 000 lbs . of beef . 60 , 000 lbs . friesland pork . 150 , 000 lbs . of stock fish . 550 , 000 lbs . of biscuit . 72 , 000 lbs . of soft bread . 2 , 800 firkins of butter . 20 , 000 lbs . texel & leyden cheese . 144 , 000 lbs . cheese ( probably an inferior article ). 550 ankers of geneva . 10 , 800 barrels of beer . most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading ; not so in the present case , however , where the reader is flooded with whole pipes , barrels , quarts , and gills of good gin and good cheer . at the time , i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer , beef , and bread , during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me , capable of a transcendental and platonic application ; and , furthermore , i compiled supplementary tables of my own , touching the probable quantity of stock - fish , etc ., consumed by every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen whale fishery . in the first place , the amount of butter , and texel and leyden cheese consumed , seems amazing . i impute it , though , to their naturally unctuous natures , being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation , and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid polar seas , on the very coasts of that esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil . the quantity of beer , too , is very large , 10 , 800 barrels . now , as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate , so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen , including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea , did not much exceed three months , say , and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail , we have 5 , 400 low dutch seamen in all ; therefore , i say , we have precisely two barrels of beer per man , for a twelve weeks \\' allowance , exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin . now , whether these gin and beer harpooneers , so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been , were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat \\' s head , and take good aim at flying whales ; this would seem somewhat improbable . yet they did aim at them , and hit them too . but this was very far north , be it remembered , where beer agrees well with the constitution ; upon the equator , in our southern fishery , beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast - head and boozy in his boat ; and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford . but no more ; enough has been said to show that the old dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers ; and that the english whalers have not neglected so excellent an example . for , say they , when cruising in an empty ship , if you can get nothing better out of the world , get a good dinner out of it , at least . and this empties the decanter . chapter 102 a bower in the arsacides . hitherto , in descriptively treating of the sperm whale , i have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect ; or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features . but to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him , it behooves me now to unbutton him still further , and untagging the points of his hose , unbuckling his garters , and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones , set him before you in his ultimatum ; that is to say , in his unconditional skeleton . but how now , ishmael ? how is it , that you , a mere oarsman in the fishery , pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale ? did erudite stubb , mounted upon your capstan , deliver lectures on the anatomy of the cetacea ; and by help of the windlass , hold up a specimen rib for exhibition ? explain thyself , ishmael . can you land a full - grown whale on your deck for examination , as a cook dishes a roast - pig ? surely not . a veritable witness have you hitherto been , ishmael ; but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone ; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams ; the rafters , ridge - pole , sleepers , and under - pinnings , making up the frame - work of leviathan ; and belike of the tallow - vats , dairy - rooms , butteries , and cheeseries in his bowels . i confess , that since jonah , few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale ; nevertheless , i have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature . in a ship i belonged to , a small cub sperm whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag , to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons , and for the heads of the lances . think you i let that chance go , without using my boat - hatchet and jack - knife , and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub ? and as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic , full grown development , for that rare knowledge i am indebted to my late royal friend tranquo , king of tranque , one of the arsacides . for being at tranque , years ago , when attached to the trading - ship dey of algiers , i was invited to spend part of the arsacidean holidays with the lord of tranque , at his retired palm villa at pupella ; a sea - side glen not very far distant from what our sailors called bamboo - town , his capital . among many other fine qualities , my royal friend tranquo , being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu , had brought together in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent ; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices , chiselled shells , inlaid spears , costly paddles , aromatic canoes ; and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders , the wonder - freighted , tribute - rendering waves had cast upon his shores . chief among these latter was a great sperm whale , which , after an unusually long raging gale , had been found dead and stranded , with his head against a cocoa - nut tree , whose plumage - like , tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet . when the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathom - deep enfoldings , and the bones become dust dry in the sun , then the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen , where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it . the ribs were hung with trophies ; the vertebrae were carved with arsacidean annals , in strange hieroglyphics ; in the skull , the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame , so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapoury spout ; while , suspended from a bough , the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees , like the hair - hung sword that so affrighted damocles . it was a wondrous sight . the wood was green as mosses of the icy glen ; the trees stood high and haughty , feeling their living sap ; the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver \\' s loom , with a gorgeous carpet on it , whereof the ground - vine tendrils formed the warp and woof , and the living flowers the figures . all the trees , with all their laden branches ; all the shrubs , and ferns , and grasses ; the message - carrying air ; all these unceasingly were active . through the lacings of the leaves , the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure . oh , busy weaver ! unseen weaver !-- pause !-- one word !-- whither flows the fabric ? what palace may it deck ? wherefore all these ceaseless toilings ? speak , weaver !-- stay thy hand !-- but one single word with thee ! nay -- the shuttle flies -- the figures float from forth the loom ; the freshet - rushing carpet for ever slides away . the weaver - god , he weaves ; and by that weaving is he deafened , that he hears no mortal voice ; and by that humming , we , too , who look on the loom are deafened ; and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it . for even so it is in all material factories . the spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles ; those same words are plainly heard without the walls , bursting from the opened casements . thereby have villainies been detected . ah , mortal ! then , be heedful ; for so , in all this din of the great world \\' s loom , thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar . now , amid the green , life - restless loom of that arsacidean wood , the great , white , worshipped skeleton lay lounging -- a gigantic idler ! yet , as the ever - woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him , the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver ; himself all woven over with the vines ; every month assuming greener , fresher verdure ; but himself a skeleton . life folded death ; death trellised life ; the grim god wived with youthful life , and begat him curly - headed glories . now , when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale , and saw the skull an altar , and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued , i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu . he laughed . but more i marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine . to and fro i paced before this skeleton -- brushed the vines aside -- broke through the ribs -- and with a ball of arsacidean twine , wandered , eddied long amid its many winding , shaded colonnades and arbours . but soon my line was out ; and following it back , i emerged from the opening where i entered . i saw no living thing within ; naught was there but bones . cutting me a green measuring - rod , i once more dived within the skeleton . from their arrow - slit in the skull , the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib , \" how now !\" they shouted ; \" dar \\' st thou measure this our god ! that \\' s for us .\" \" aye , priests -- well , how long do ye make him , then ?\" but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them , concerning feet and inches ; they cracked each other \\' s sconces with their yard - sticks -- the great skull echoed -- and seizing that lucky chance , i quickly concluded my own admeasurements . these admeasurements i now propose to set before you . but first , be it recorded , that , in this matter , i am not free to utter any fancied measurement i please . because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to , to test my accuracy . there is a leviathanic museum , they tell me , in hull , england , one of the whaling ports of that country , where they have some fine specimens of fin - backs and other whales . likewise , i have heard that in the museum of manchester , in new hampshire , they have what the proprietors call \" the only perfect specimen of a greenland or river whale in the united states .\" moreover , at a place in yorkshire , england , burton constable by name , a certain sir clifford constable has in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale , but of moderate size , by no means of the full - grown magnitude of my friend king tranquo \\' s . in both cases , the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged , were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds . king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it ; and sir clifford , because he was lord of the seignories of those parts . sir clifford \\' s whale has been articulated throughout ; so that , like a great chest of drawers , you can open and shut him , in all his bony cavities -- spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan -- and swing all day upon his lower jaw . locks are to be put upon some of his trap - doors and shutters ; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side . sir clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column ; threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum ; and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead . the skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm , where i had them tattooed ; as in my wild wanderings at that period , there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics . but as i was crowded for space , and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was then composing -- at least , what untattooed parts might remain -- i did not trouble myself with the odd inches ; nor , indeed , should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale . chapter 103 measurement of the whale \\' s skeleton . in the first place , i wish to lay before you a particular , plain statement , touching the living bulk of this leviathan , whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit . such a statement may prove useful here . according to a careful calculation i have made , and which i partly base upon captain scoresby \\' s estimate , of seventy tons for the largest sized greenland whale of sixty feet in length ; according to my careful calculation , i say , a sperm whale of the largest magnitude , between eighty - five and ninety feet in length , and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference , such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons ; so that , reckoning thirteen men to a ton , he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants . think you not then that brains , like yoked cattle , should be put to this leviathan , to make him at all budge to any landsman \\' s imagination ? having already in various ways put before you his skull , spout - hole , jaw , teeth , tail , forehead , fins , and divers other parts , i shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones . but as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton ; as it is by far the most complicated part ; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter , you must not fail to carry it in your mind , or under your arm , as we proceed , otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view . in length , the sperm whale \\' s skeleton at tranque measured seventy - two feet ; so that when fully invested and extended in life , he must have been ninety feet long ; for in the whale , the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body . of this seventy - two feet , his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet , leaving some fifty feet of plain back - bone . attached to this back - bone , for something less than a third of its length , was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals . to me this vast ivory - ribbed chest , with the long , unrelieved spine , extending far away from it in a straight line , not a little resembled the hull of a great ship new - laid upon the stocks , when only some twenty of her naked bow - ribs are inserted , and the keel is otherwise , for the time , but a long , disconnected timber . the ribs were ten on a side . the first , to begin from the neck , was nearly six feet long ; the second , third , and fourth were each successively longer , till you came to the climax of the fifth , or one of the middle ribs , which measured eight feet and some inches . from that part , the remaining ribs diminished , till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches . in general thickness , they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length . the middle ribs were the most arched . in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams . in considering these ribs , i could not but be struck anew with the circumstance , so variously repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form . the largest of the tranque ribs , one of the middle ones , occupied that part of the fish which , in life , is greatest in depth . now , the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet ; whereas , the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet . so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part . besides , for some way , where i now saw but a naked spine , all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh , muscle , blood , and bowels . still more , for the ample fins , i here saw but a few disordered joints ; and in place of the weighty and majestic , but boneless flukes , an utter blank ! how vain and foolish , then , thought i , for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale , by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton , stretched in this peaceful wood . no . only in the heart of quickest perils ; only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes ; only on the profound unbounded sea , can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out . but the spine . for that , the best way we can consider it is , with a crane , to pile its bones high up on end . no speedy enterprise . but now it \\' s done , it looks much like pompey \\' s pillar . there are forty and odd vertebrae in all , which in the skeleton are not locked together . they mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a gothic spire , forming solid courses of heavy masonry . the largest , a middle one , is in width something less than three feet , and in depth more than four . the smallest , where the spine tapers away into the tail , is only two inches in width , and looks something like a white billiard - ball . i was told that there were still smaller ones , but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins , the priest \\' s children , who had stolen them to play marbles with . thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple child \\' s play . chapter 104 the fossil whale . from his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge , amplify , and generally expatiate . would you , you could not compress him . by good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio . not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail , and the yards he measures about the waist ; only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines , where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop - deck of a line - of - battle - ship . since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan , it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise ; not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood , and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels . having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities , it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological , fossiliferous , and antediluvian point of view . applied to any other creature than the leviathan -- to an ant or a flea -- such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent . but when leviathan is the text , the case is altered . fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary . and here be it said , that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations , i have invariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson , expressly purchased for that purpose ; because that famous lexicographer \\' s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me . one often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject , though it may seem but an ordinary one . how , then , with me , writing of this leviathan ? unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals . give me a condor \\' s quill ! give me vesuvius \\' crater for an inkstand ! friends , hold my arms ! for in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this leviathan , they weary me , and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep , as if to include the whole circle of the sciences , and all the generations of whales , and men , and mastodons , past , present , and to come , with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth , and throughout the whole universe , not excluding its suburbs . such , and so magnifying , is the virtue of a large and liberal theme ! we expand to its bulk . to produce a mighty book , you must choose a mighty theme . no great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea , though many there be who have tried it . ere entering upon the subject of fossil whales , i present my credentials as a geologist , by stating that in my miscellaneous time i have been a stone - mason , and also a great digger of ditches , canals and wells , wine - vaults , cellars , and cisterns of all sorts . likewise , by way of preliminary , i desire to remind the reader , that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct ; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the tertiary formations seem the connecting , or at any rate intercepted links , between the antichronical creatures , and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the ark ; all the fossil whales hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary period , which is the last preceding the superficial formations . and though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time , they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects , to justify their taking rank as cetacean fossils . detached broken fossils of pre - adamite whales , fragments of their bones and skeletons , have within thirty years past , at various intervals , been found at the base of the alps , in lombardy , in france , in england , in scotland , and in the states of louisiana , mississippi , and alabama . among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull , which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris , a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries ; and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of antwerp , in napoleon \\' s time . cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown leviathanic species . but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster , found in the year 1842 , on the plantation of judge creagh , in alabama . the awe - stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels . the alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile , and bestowed upon it the name of basilosaurus . but some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to owen , the english anatomist , it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale , though of a departed species . a significant illustration of the fact , again and again repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body . so owen rechristened the monster zeuglodon ; and in his paper read before the london geological society , pronounced it , in substance , one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence . when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons , skulls , tusks , jaws , ribs , and vertebrae , all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of sea - monsters ; but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical leviathans , their incalculable seniors ; i am , by a flood , borne back to that wondrous period , ere time itself can be said to have begun ; for time began with man . here saturn \\' s grey chaos rolls over me , and i obtain dim , shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities ; when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics ; and in all the 25 , 000 miles of this world \\' s circumference , not an inhabitable hand \\' s breadth of land was visible . then the whole world was the whale \\' s ; and , king of creation , he left his wake along the present lines of the andes and the himmalehs . who can show a pedigree like leviathan ? ahab \\' s harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaoh \\' s . methuselah seems a school - boy . i look round to shake hands with shem . i am horror - struck at this antemosaic , unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale , which , having been before all time , must needs exist after all humane ages are over . but not alone has this leviathan left his pre - adamite traces in the stereotype plates of nature , and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust ; but upon egyptian tablets , whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous character , we find the unmistakable print of his fin . in an apartment of the great temple of denderah , some fifty years ago , there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere , abounding in centaurs , griffins , and dolphins , similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns . gliding among them , old leviathan swam as of yore ; was there swimming in that planisphere , centuries before solomon was cradled . nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale , in his own osseous post - diluvian reality , as set down by the venerable john leo , the old barbary traveller . \" not far from the sea - side , they have a temple , the rafters and beams of which are made of whale - bones ; for whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore . the common people imagine , that by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple , no whale can pass it without immediate death . but the truth of the matter is , that on either side of the temple , there are rocks that shoot two miles into the sea , and wound the whales when they light upon \\' em . they keep a whale \\' s rib of an incredible length for a miracle , which lying upon the ground with its convex part uppermost , makes an arch , the head of which cannot be reached by a man upon a camel \\' s back . this rib ( says john leo ) is said to have layn there a hundred years before i saw it . their historians affirm , that a prophet who prophesy \\' d of mahomet , came from this temple , and some do not stand to assert , that the prophet jonas was cast forth by the whale at the base of the temple .\" in this afric temple of the whale i leave you , reader , and if you be a nantucketer , and a whaleman , you will silently worship there . chapter 105 does the whale \\' s magnitude diminish ?-- will he perish ? inasmuch , then , as this leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the head - waters of the eternities , it may be fitly inquired , whether , in the long course of his generations , he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires . but upon investigation we find , that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the tertiary system ( embracing a distinct geological period prior to man ), but of the whales found in that tertiary system , those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones . of all the pre - adamite whales yet exhumed , by far the largest is the alabama one mentioned in the last chapter , and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton . whereas , we have already seen , that the tape - measure gives seventy - two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale . and i have heard , on whalemen \\' s authority , that sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture . but may it not be , that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods ; may it not be , that since adam \\' s time they have degenerated ? assuredly , we must conclude so , if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as pliny , and the ancient naturalists generally . for pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk , and aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length -- rope walks and thames tunnels of whales ! and even in the days of banks and solander , cooke \\' s naturalists , we find a danish member of the academy of sciences setting down certain iceland whales ( reydan - siskur , or wrinkled bellies ) at one hundred and twenty yards ; that is , three hundred and sixty feet . and lacepede , the french naturalist , in his elaborate history of whales , in the very beginning of his work ( page 3 ), sets down the right whale at one hundred metres , three hundred and twenty - eight feet . and this work was published so late as a . d . 1825 . but will any whaleman believe these stories ? no . the whale of to - day is as big as his ancestors in pliny \\' s time . and if ever i go where pliny is , i , a whaleman ( more than he was ), will make bold to tell him so . because i cannot understand how it is , that while the egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even pliny was born , do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern kentuckian in his socks ; and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest egyptian and nineveh tablets , by the relative proportions in which they are drawn , just as plainly prove that the high - bred , stall - fed , prize cattle of smithfield , not only equal , but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of pharaoh \\' s fat kine ; in the face of all this , i will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated . but still another inquiry remains ; one often agitated by the more recondite nantucketers . whether owing to the almost omniscient look - outs at the mast - heads of the whaleships , now penetrating even through behring \\' s straits , and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world ; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts ; the moot point is , whether leviathan can long endure so wide a chase , and so remorseless a havoc ; whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters , and the last whale , like the last man , smoke his last pipe , and then himself evaporate in the final puff . comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo , which , not forty years ago , overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of illinois and missouri , and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunder - clotted brows upon the sites of populous river - capitals , where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch ; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished , to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction . but you must look at this matter in every light . though so short a period ago -- not a good lifetime -- the census of the buffalo in illinois exceeded the census of men now in london , and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region ; and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man ; yet the far different nature of the whale - hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the leviathan . forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whales for forty - eight months think they have done extremely well , and thank god , if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish . whereas , in the days of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the west , when the far west ( in whose sunset suns still rise ) was a wilderness and a virgin , the same number of moccasined men , for the same number of months , mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships , would have slain not forty , but forty thousand and more buffaloes ; a fact that , if need were , could be statistically stated . nor , considered aright , does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the sperm whale , for example , that in former years ( the latter part of the last century , say ) these leviathans , in small pods , were encountered much oftener than at present , and , in consequence , the voyages were not so prolonged , and were also much more remunerative . because , as has been elsewhere noticed , those whales , influenced by some views to safety , now swim the seas in immense caravans , so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries , yokes , and pods , and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated , unfrequent armies . that is all . and equally fallacious seems the conceit , that because the so - called whale - bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them , hence that species also is declining . for they are only being driven from promontory to cape ; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets , then , be sure , some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle . furthermore : concerning these last mentioned leviathans , they have two firm fortresses , which , in all human probability , will for ever remain impregnable . and as upon the invasion of their valleys , the frosty swiss have retreated to their mountains ; so , hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas , the whale - bone whales can at last resort to their polar citadels , and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there , come up among icy fields and floes ; and in a charmed circle of everlasting december , bid defiance to all pursuit from man . but as perhaps fifty of these whale - bone whales are harpooned for one cachalot , some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions . but though for some time past a number of these whales , not less than 13 , 000 , have been annually slain on the nor \\'- west coast by the americans alone ; yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter . natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe , yet what shall we say to harto , the historian of goa , when he tells us that at one hunting the king of siam took 4 , 000 elephants ; that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes . and there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants , which have now been hunted for thousands of years , by semiramis , by porus , by hannibal , and by all the successive monarchs of the east -- if they still survive there in great numbers , much more may the great whale outlast all hunting , since he has a pasture to expatiate in , which is precisely twice as large as all asia , both americas , europe and africa , new holland , and all the isles of the sea combined . moreover : we are to consider , that from the presumed great longevity of whales , their probably attaining the age of a century and more , therefore at any one period of time , several distinct adult generations must be contemporary . and what that is , we may soon gain some idea of , by imagining all the grave - yards , cemeteries , and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men , women , and children who were alive seventy - five years ago ; and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe . wherefore , for all these things , we account the whale immortal in his species , however perishable in his individuality . he swam the seas before the continents broke water ; he once swam over the site of the tuileries , and windsor castle , and the kremlin . in noah \\' s flood he despised noah \\' s ark ; and if ever the world is to be again flooded , like the netherlands , to kill off its rats , then the eternal whale will still survive , and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood , spout his frothed defiance to the skies . chapter 106 ahab \\' s leg . the precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuel enderby of london , had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person . he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half - splintering shock . and when after gaining his own deck , and his own pivot - hole there , he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman ( it was , as ever , something about his not steering inflexibly enough ); then , the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench , that though it still remained entire , and to all appearances lusty , yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy . and , indeed , it seemed small matter for wonder , that for all his pervading , mad recklessness , ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood . for it had not been very long prior to the pequod \\' s sailing from nantucket , that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground , and insensible ; by some unknown , and seemingly inexplicable , unimaginable casualty , his ivory limb having been so violently displaced , that it had stake - wise smitten , and all but pierced his groin ; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured . nor , at the time , had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind , that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe ; and he too plainly seemed to see , that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove ; so , equally with every felicity , all miserable events do naturally beget their like . yea , more than equally , thought ahab ; since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of joy . for , not to hint of this : that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings , that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world , but , on the contrary , shall be followed by the joy - childlessness of all hell \\' s despair ; whereas , some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave ; not at all to hint of this , there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing . for , thought ahab , while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them , but , at bottom , all heartwoes , a mystic significance , and , in some men , an archangelic grandeur ; so do their diligent tracings - out not belie the obvious deduction . to trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries , carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods ; so that , in the face of all the glad , hay - making suns , and soft cymballing , round harvest - moons , we must needs give in to this : that the gods themselves are not for ever glad . the ineffaceable , sad birth - mark in the brow of man , is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers . unwittingly here a secret has been divulged , which perhaps might more properly , in set way , have been disclosed before . with many other particulars concerning ahab , always had it remained a mystery to some , why it was , that for a certain period , both before and after the sailing of the pequod , he had hidden himself away with such grand - lama - like exclusiveness ; and , for that one interval , sought speechless refuge , as it were , among the marble senate of the dead . captain peleg \\' s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate ; though , indeed , as touching all ahab \\' s deeper part , every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light . but , in the end , it all came out ; this one matter did , at least . that direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness . and not only this , but to that ever - contracting , dropping circle ashore , who , for any reason , possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him ; to that timid circle the above hinted casualty -- remaining , as it did , moodily unaccounted for by ahab -- invested itself with terrors , not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails . so that , through their zeal for him , they had all conspired , so far as in them lay , to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others ; and hence it was , that not till a considerable interval had elapsed , did it transpire upon the pequod \\' s decks . but be all this as it may ; let the unseen , ambiguous synod in the air , or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire , have to do or not with earthly ahab , yet , in this present matter of his leg , he took plain practical procedures ;-- he called the carpenter . and when that functionary appeared before him , he bade him without delay set about making a new leg , and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw - ivory ( sperm whale ) which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage , in order that a careful selection of the stoutest , clearest - grained stuff might be secured . this done , the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night ; and to provide all the fittings for it , independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use . moreover , the ship \\' s forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold ; and , to accelerate the affair , the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed . chapter 107 the carpenter . seat thyself sultanically among the moons of saturn , and take high abstracted man alone ; and he seems a wonder , a grandeur , and a woe . but from the same point , take mankind in mass , and for the most part , they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates , both contemporary and hereditary . but most humble though he was , and far from furnishing an example of the high , humane abstraction ; the pequod \\' s carpenter was no duplicate ; hence , he now comes in person on this stage . like all sea - going ship carpenters , and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels , he was , to a certain off - handed , practical extent , alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own ; the carpenter \\' s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material . but , besides the application to him of the generic remark above , this carpenter of the pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship , upon a three or four years \\' voyage , in uncivilized and far - distant seas . for not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties :-- repairing stove boats , sprung spars , reforming the shape of clumsy - bladed oars , inserting bull \\' s eyes in the deck , or new tree - nails in the side planks , and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business ; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes , both useful and capricious . the one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold , was his vice - bench ; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices , of different sizes , and both of iron and of wood . at all times except when whales were alongside , this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the try - works . a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole : the carpenter claps it into one of his ever - ready vices , and straightway files it smaller . a lost land - bird of strange plumage strays on board , and is made a captive : out of clean shaved rods of right - whale bone , and cross - beams of sperm whale ivory , the carpenter makes a pagoda - looking cage for it . an oarsman sprains his wrist : the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion . stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar ; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood , the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation . a sailor takes a fancy to wear shark - bone ear - rings : the carpenter drills his ears . another has the toothache : the carpenter out pincers , and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there ; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation ; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice , the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that , if he would have him draw the tooth . thus , this carpenter was prepared at all points , and alike indifferent and without respect in all . teeth he accounted bits of ivory ; heads he deemed but top - blocks ; men themselves he lightly held for capstans . but while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him , too ; all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence . but not precisely so . for nothing was this man more remarkable , than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were ; impersonal , i say ; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things , that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world ; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes , still eternally holds its peace , and ignores you , though you dig foundations for cathedrals . yet was this half - horrible stolidity in him , involving , too , as it appeared , an all - ramifying heartlessness ;-- yet was it oddly dashed at times , with an old , crutch - like , antediluvian , wheezing humorousness , not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness ; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of noah \\' s ark . was it that this old carpenter had been a life - long wanderer , whose much rolling , to and fro , not only had gathered no moss ; but what is more , had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him ? he was a stript abstract ; an unfractioned integral ; uncompromised as a new - born babe ; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next . you might almost say , that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence ; for in his numerous trades , he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct , or simply because he had been tutored to it , or by any intermixture of all these , even or uneven ; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb , spontaneous literal process . he was a pure manipulator ; his brain , if he had ever had one , must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers . he was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful , multum in parvo , sheffield contrivances , assuming the exterior -- though a little swelled -- of a common pocket knife ; but containing , not only blades of various sizes , but also screw - drivers , cork - screws , tweezers , awls , pens , rulers , nail - filers , countersinkers . so , if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screw - driver , all they had to do was to open that part of him , and the screw was fast : or if for tweezers , take him up by the legs , and there they were . yet , as previously hinted , this omnitooled , open - and - shut carpenter , was , after all , no mere machine of an automaton . if he did not have a common soul in him , he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty . what that was , whether essence of quicksilver , or a few drops of hartshorn , there is no telling . but there it was ; and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more . and this it was , this same unaccountable , cunning life - principle in him ; this it was , that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing ; but only like an unreasoning wheel , which also hummingly soliloquizes ; or rather , his body was a sentry - box and this soliloquizer on guard there , and talking all the time to keep himself awake . chapter 108 ahab and the carpenter . the deck -- first night watch .

that is , carpenter , my old lost leg ; the flesh and blood one , i mean . canst thou not drive that old adam away ? truly , sir , i begin to understand somewhat now . yes , i have heard something curious on that score , sir ; how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar , but it will be still pricking him at times . may i humbly ask if it be really so , sir ? it is , man . look , put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was ; so , now , here is only one distinct leg to the eye , yet two to the soul . where thou feelest tingling life ; there , exactly there , there to a hair , do i . is \\' t a riddle ? i should humbly call it a poser , sir . hist , then . how dost thou know that some entire , living , thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest ;

then , why mayst not thou , carpenter , feel the fiery pains of hell for ever , and without a body ? hah ! good lord ! truly , sir , if it comes to that , i must calculate over again ; i think i didn \\' t carry a small figure , sir . look ye , pudding - heads should never grant premises .-- how long before the leg is done ? perhaps an hour , sir . bungle away at it then , and bring it to me ( turns to go ). oh , life ! here i am , proud as greek god , and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on ! cursed be that mortal inter - indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers . i would be free as air ;

says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer ; he \\' s queer , says stubb ; he \\' s queer -- queer , queer ; and keeps dinning it into mr . starbuck all the time -- queer -- sir -- queer , queer , very queer . and here \\' s his leg ! yes , now that i think of it , here \\' s his bedfellow ! has a stick of whale \\' s jaw - bone for a wife ! and this is his leg ; he \\' ll stand on this . what was that now about one leg standing in three places , and all three places standing in one hell -- how was that ? oh ! i don \\' t wonder he looked so scornful at me ! i \\' m a sort of strange - thoughted sometimes , they say ; but that \\' s only haphazard - like . then , a short , little old body like me , should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall , heron - built captains ; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick , and there \\' s a great cry for life - boats . and here \\' s the heron \\' s leg ! long and slim , sure enough ! now , for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime , and that must be because they use them mercifully , as a tender - hearted old lady uses her roly - poly old coach - horses . but ahab ; oh he \\' s a hard driver . look , driven one leg to death , and spavined the other for life , and now wears out bone legs by the cord . halloa , there , you smut ! bear a hand there with those screws , and let \\' s finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a - calling with his horn for all legs , true or false , as brewery - men go round collecting old beer barrels , to fill \\' em up again . what a leg this is ! it looks like a real live leg , filed down to nothing but the core ; he \\' ll be standing on this to - morrow ; he \\' ll be taking altitudes on it . halloa ! i almost forgot the little oval slate , smoothed ivory , where he figures up the latitude . so , so ; chisel , file , and sand - paper , now ! chapter 109 ahab and starbuck in the cabin . according to usage they were pumping the ship next morning ; and lo ! no inconsiderable oil came up with the water ; the casks below must have sprung a bad leak . much concern was shown ; and starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair .* * in sperm - whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board , it is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold , and drench the casks with sea - water ; which afterwards , at varying intervals , is removed by the ship \\' s pumps . hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight ; while by the changed character of the withdrawn water , the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo . now , from the south and west the pequod was drawing nigh to formosa and the bashee isles , between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the china waters into the pacific . and so starbuck found ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him ; and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the japanese islands -- niphon , matsmai , and sikoke . with his snow - white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table , and with a long pruning - hook of a jack - knife in his hand , the wondrous old man , with his back to the gangway door , was wrinkling his brow , and tracing his old courses again . \" who \\' s there ?\" hearing the footstep at the door , but not turning round to it . \" on deck ! begone !\" \" captain ahab mistakes ; it is i . the oil in the hold is leaking , sir . we must up burtons and break out .\" \" up burtons and break out ? now that we are nearing japan ; heave - to here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops ?\" \" either do that , sir , or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year . what we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving , sir .\" \" so it is , so it is ; if we get it .\" \" i was speaking of the oil in the hold , sir .\" \" and i was not speaking or thinking of that at all . begone ! let it leak ! i \\' m all aleak myself . aye ! leaks in leaks ! not only full of leaky casks , but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship ; and that \\' s a far worse plight than the pequod \\' s , man . yet i don \\' t stop to plug my leak ; for who can find it in the deep - loaded hull ; or how hope to plug it , even if found , in this life \\' s howling gale ? starbuck ! i \\' ll not have the burtons hoisted .\" \" what will the owners say , sir ?\" \" let the owners stand on nantucket beach and outyell the typhoons . what cares ahab ? owners , owners ? thou art always prating to me , starbuck , about those miserly owners , as if the owners were my conscience . but look ye , the only real owner of anything is its commander ; and hark ye , my conscience is in this ship \\' s keel .-- on deck !\" \" captain ahab ,\" said the reddening mate , moving further into the cabin , with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself , but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself ; \" a better man than i might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man ; aye , and in a happier , captain ahab .\" \" devils ! dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me ?-- on deck !\" \" nay , sir , not yet ; i do entreat . and i do dare , sir -- to be forbearing ! shall we not understand each other better than hitherto , captain ahab ?\" ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack ( forming part of most south - sea - men \\' s cabin furniture ), and pointing it towards starbuck , exclaimed : \" there is one god that is lord over the earth , and one captain that is lord over the pequod .-- on deck !\" for an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate , and his fiery cheeks , you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled tube . but , mastering his emotion , he half calmly rose , and as he quitted the cabin , paused for an instant and said : \" thou hast outraged , not insulted me , sir ; but for that i ask thee not to beware of starbuck ; thou wouldst but laugh ; but let ahab beware of ahab ; beware of thyself , old man .\" \" he waxes brave , but nevertheless obeys ; most careful bravery that !\" murmured ahab , as starbuck disappeared . \" what \\' s that he said -- ahab beware of ahab -- there \\' s something there !\" then unconsciously using the musket for a staff , with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin ; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed , and returning the gun to the rack , he went to the deck . \" thou art but too good a fellow , starbuck ,\" he said lowly to the mate ; then raising his voice to the crew : \" furl the t \\' gallant - sails , and close - reef the top - sails , fore and aft ; back the main - yard ; up burton , and break out in the main - hold .\" it were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was , that as respecting starbuck , ahab thus acted . it may have been a flash of honesty in him ; or mere prudential policy which , under the circumstance , imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection , however transient , in the important chief officer of his ship . however it was , his orders were executed ; and the burtons were hoisted . chapter 110 queequeg in his coffin . upon searching , it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound , and that the leak must be further off . so , it being calm weather , they broke out deeper and deeper , disturbing the slumbers of the huge ground - tier butts ; and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above . so deep did they go ; and so ancient , and corroded , and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons , that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner - stone cask containing coins of captain noah , with copies of the posted placards , vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood . tierce after tierce , too , of water , and bread , and beef , and shooks of staves , and iron bundles of hoops , were hoisted out , till at last the piled decks were hard to get about ; and the hollow hull echoed under foot , as if you were treading over empty catacombs , and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air - freighted demijohn . top - heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all aristotle in his head . well was it that the typhoons did not visit them then . now , at this time it was that my poor pagan companion , and fast bosom - friend , queequeg , was seized with a fever , which brought him nigh to his endless end . be it said , that in this vocation of whaling , sinecures are unknown ; dignity and danger go hand in hand ; till you get to be captain , the higher you rise the harder you toil . so with poor queequeg , who , as harpooneer , must not only face all the rage of the living whale , but -- as we have elsewhere seen -- mount his dead back in a rolling sea ; and finally descend into the gloom of the hold , and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement , resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage . to be short , among whalemen , the harpooneers are the holders , so called . poor queequeg ! when the ship was about half disembowelled , you should have stooped over the hatchway , and peered down upon him there ; where , stripped to his woollen drawers , the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime , like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well . and a well , or an ice - house , it somehow proved to him , poor pagan ; where , strange to say , for all the heat of his sweatings , he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever ; and at last , after some days \\' suffering , laid him in his hammock , close to the very sill of the door of death . how he wasted and wasted away in those few long - lingering days , till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing . but as all else in him thinned , and his cheek - bones grew sharper , his eyes , nevertheless , seemed growing fuller and fuller ; they became of a strange softness of lustre ; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness , a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die , or be weakened . and like circles on the water , which , as they grow fainter , expand ; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding , like the rings of eternity . an awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage , and saw as strange things in his face , as any beheld who were bystanders when zoroaster died . for whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man , never yet was put into words or books . and the drawing near of death , which alike levels all , alike impresses all with a last revelation , which only an author from the dead could adequately tell . so that -- let us say it again -- no dying chaldee or greek had higher and holier thoughts than those , whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor queequeg , as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock , and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest , and the ocean \\' s invisible flood - tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven . not a man of the crew but gave him up ; and , as for queequeg himself , what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked . he called one to him in the grey morning watch , when the day was just breaking , and taking his hand , said that while in nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood , like the rich war - wood of his native isle ; and upon inquiry , he had learned that all whalemen who died in nantucket , were laid in those same dark canoes , and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him ; for it was not unlike the custom of his own race , who , after embalming a dead warrior , stretched him out in his canoe , and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes ; for not only do they believe that the stars are isles , but that far beyond all visible horizons , their own mild , uncontinented seas , interflow with the blue heavens ; and so form the white breakers of the milky way . he added , that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock , according to the usual sea - custom , tossed like something vile to the death - devouring sharks . no : he desired a canoe like those of nantucket , all the more congenial to him , being a whaleman , that like a whale - boat these coffin - canoes were without a keel ; though that involved but uncertain steering , and much lee - way adown the dim ages . now , when this strange circumstance was made known aft , the carpenter was at once commanded to do queequeg \\' s bidding , whatever it might include . there was some heathenish , coffin - coloured old lumber aboard , which , upon a long previous voyage , had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the lackaday islands , and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made . no sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order , than taking his rule , he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character , proceeded into the forecastle and took queequeg \\' s measure with great accuracy , regularly chalking queequeg \\' s person as he shifted the rule . \" ah ! poor fellow ! he \\' ll have to die now ,\" ejaculated the long island sailor . going to his vice - bench , the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference , now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be , and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities . this done , he marshalled the planks and his tools , and to work . when the last nail was driven , and the lid duly planed and fitted , he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it , inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction . overhearing the indignant but half - humorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away , queequeg , to every one \\' s consternation , commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him , nor was there any denying him ; seeing that , of all mortals , some dying men are the most tyrannical ; and certainly , since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore , the poor fellows ought to be indulged . leaning over in his hammock , queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye . he then called for his harpoon , had the wooden stock drawn from it , and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat . all by his own request , also , biscuits were then ranged round the sides within : a flask of fresh water was placed at the head , and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot ; and a piece of sail - cloth being rolled up for a pillow , queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed , that he might make trial of its comforts , if any it had . he lay without moving a few minutes , then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god , yojo . then crossing his arms on his breast with yojo between , he called for the coffin lid ( hatch he called it ) to be placed over him . the head part turned over with a leather hinge , and there lay queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view . \" rarmai \" ( it will do ; it is easy ), he murmured at last , and signed to be replaced in his hammock . but ere this was done , pip , who had been slily hovering near by all this while , drew nigh to him where he lay , and with soft sobbings , took him by the hand ; in the other , holding his tambourine . \" poor rover ! will ye never have done with all this weary roving ? where go ye now ? but if the currents carry ye to those sweet antilles where the beaches are only beat with water - lilies , will ye do one little errand for me ? seek out one pip , who \\' s now been missing long : i think he \\' s in those far antilles . if ye find him , then comfort him ; for he must be very sad ; for look ! he \\' s left his tambourine behind ;-- i found it . rig - a - dig , dig , dig ! now , queequeg , die ; and i \\' ll beat ye your dying march .\" \" i have heard ,\" murmured starbuck , gazing down the scuttle , \" that in violent fevers , men , all ignorance , have talked in ancient tongues ; and that when the mystery is probed , it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars . so , to my fond faith , poor pip , in this strange sweetness of his lunacy , brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes . where learned he that , but there ?-- hark ! he speaks again : but more wildly now .\" \" form two and two ! let \\' s make a general of him ! ho , where \\' s his harpoon ? lay it across here .-- rig - a - dig , dig , dig ! huzza ! oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow ! queequeg dies game !-- mind ye that ; queequeg dies game !-- take ye good heed of that ; queequeg dies game ! i say ; game , game , game ! but base little pip , he died a coward ; died all a \\' shiver ;-- out upon pip ! hark ye ; if ye find pip , tell all the antilles he \\' s a runaway ; a coward , a coward , a coward ! tell them he jumped from a whale - boat ! i \\' d never beat my tambourine over base pip , and hail him general , if he were once more dying here . no , no ! shame upon all cowards -- shame upon them ! let \\' em go drown like pip , that jumped from a whale - boat . shame ! shame !\" during all this , queequeg lay with closed eyes , as if in a dream . pip was led away , and the sick man was replaced in his hammock . but now that he had apparently made every preparation for death ; now that his coffin was proved a good fit , queequeg suddenly rallied ; soon there seemed no need of the carpenter \\' s box : and thereupon , when some expressed their delighted surprise , he , in substance , said , that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this ;-- at a critical moment , he had just recalled a little duty ashore , which he was leaving undone ; and therefore had changed his mind about dying : he could not die yet , he averred . they asked him , then , whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure . he answered , certainly . in a word , it was queequeg \\' s conceit , that if a man made up his mind to live , mere sickness could not kill him : nothing but a whale , or a gale , or some violent , ungovernable , unintelligent destroyer of that sort . now , there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized ; that while a sick , civilized man may be six months convalescing , generally speaking , a sick savage is almost half - well again in a day . so , in good time my queequeg gained strength ; and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days ( but eating with a vigorous appetite ) he suddenly leaped to his feet , threw out his arms and legs , gave himself a good stretching , yawned a little bit , and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat , and poising a harpoon , pronounced himself fit for a fight . with a wild whimsiness , he now used his coffin for a sea - chest ; and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes , set them in order there . many spare hours he spent , in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings ; and it seemed that hereby he was striving , in his rude way , to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body . and this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island , who , by those hieroglyphic marks , had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth , and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth ; so that queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold ; a wondrous work in one volume ; but whose mysteries not even himself could read , though his own live heart beat against them ; and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed , and so be unsolved to the last . and this thought it must have been which suggested to ahab that wild exclamation of his , when one morning turning away from surveying poor queequeg --\" oh , devilish tantalization of the gods !\" chapter 111 the pacific . when gliding by the bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great south sea ; were it not for other things , i could have greeted my dear pacific with uncounted thanks , for now the long supplication of my youth was answered ; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue . there is , one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea , whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath ; like those fabled undulations of the ephesian sod over the buried evangelist st . john . and meet it is , that over these sea - pastures , wide - rolling watery prairies and potters \\' fields of all four continents , the waves should rise and fall , and ebb and flow unceasingly ; for here , millions of mixed shades and shadows , drowned dreams , somnambulisms , reveries ; all that we call lives and souls , lie dreaming , dreaming , still ; tossing like slumberers in their beds ; the ever - rolling waves but made so by their restlessness . to any meditative magian rover , this serene pacific , once beheld , must ever after be the sea of his adoption . it rolls the midmost waters of the world , the indian ocean and atlantic being but its arms . the same waves wash the moles of the new - built californian towns , but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men , and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of asiatic lands , older than abraham ; while all between float milky - ways of coral isles , and low - lying , endless , unknown archipelagoes , and impenetrable japans . thus this mysterious , divine pacific zones the world \\' s whole bulk about ; makes all coasts one bay to it ; seems the tide - beating heart of earth . lifted by those eternal swells , you needs must own the seductive god , bowing your head to pan . but few thoughts of pan stirred ahab \\' s brain , as standing like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging , with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the bashee isles ( in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking ), and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea ; that sea in which the hated white whale must even then be swimming . launched at length upon these almost final waters , and gliding towards the japanese cruising - ground , the old man \\' s purpose intensified itself . his firm lips met like the lips of a vice ; the delta of his forehead \\' s veins swelled like overladen brooks ; in his very sleep , his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull , \" stern all ! the white whale spouts thick blood !\" chapter 112 the blacksmith . availing himself of the mild , summer - cool weather that now reigned in these latitudes , and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated , perth , the begrimed , blistered old blacksmith , had not removed his portable forge to the hold again , after concluding his contributory work for ahab \\' s leg , but still retained it on deck , fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast ; being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen , and harpooneers , and bowsmen to do some little job for them ; altering , or repairing , or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture . often he would be surrounded by an eager circle , all waiting to be served ; holding boat - spades , pike - heads , harpoons , and lances , and jealously watching his every sooty movement , as he toiled . nevertheless , this old man \\' s was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm . no murmur , no impatience , no petulance did come from him . silent , slow , and solemn ; bowing over still further his chronically broken back , he toiled away , as if toil were life itself , and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart . and so it was .-- most miserable ! a peculiar walk in this old man , a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait , had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners . and to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally given in ; and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate . belated , and not innocently , one bitter winter \\' s midnight , on the road running between two country towns , the blacksmith half - stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him , and sought refuge in a leaning , dilapidated barn . the issue was , the loss of the extremities of both feet . out of this revelation , part by part , at last came out the four acts of the gladness , and the one long , and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life \\' s drama . he was an old man , who , at the age of nearly sixty , had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrow \\' s technicals called ruin . he had been an artisan of famed excellence , and with plenty to do ; owned a house and garden ; embraced a youthful , daughter - like , loving wife , and three blithe , ruddy children ; every sunday went to a cheerful - looking church , planted in a grove . but one night , under cover of darkness , and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement , a desperate burglar slid into his happy home , and robbed them all of everything . and darker yet to tell , the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family \\' s heart . it was the bottle conjuror ! upon the opening of that fatal cork , forth flew the fiend , and shrivelled up his home . now , for prudent , most wise , and economic reasons , the blacksmith \\' s shop was in the basement of his dwelling , but with a separate entrance to it ; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness , but with vigorous pleasure , to the stout ringing of her young - armed old husband \\' s hammer ; whose reverberations , muffled by passing through the floors and walls , came up to her , not unsweetly , in her nursery ; and so , to stout labor \\' s iron lullaby , the blacksmith \\' s infants were rocked to slumber . oh , woe on woe ! oh , death , why canst thou not sometimes be timely ? hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him , then had the young widow had a delicious grief , and her orphans a truly venerable , legendary sire to dream of in their after years ; and all of them a care - killing competency . but death plucked down some virtuous elder brother , on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family , and left the worse than useless old man standing , till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest . why tell the whole ? the blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and more between ; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last ; the wife sat frozen at the window , with tearless eyes , glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children ; the bellows fell ; the forge choked up with cinders ; the house was sold ; the mother dived down into the long church - yard grass ; her children twice followed her thither ; and the houseless , familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape ; his every woe unreverenced ; his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls ! death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this ; but death is only a launching into the region of the strange untried ; it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense remote , the wild , the watery , the unshored ; therefore , to the death - longing eyes of such men , who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide , does the all - contributed and all - receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable , taking terrors , and wonderful , new - life adventures ; and from the hearts of infinite pacifics , the thousand mermaids sing to them --\" come hither , broken - hearted ; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death ; here are wonders supernatural , without dying for them . come hither ! bury thyself in a life which , to your now equally abhorred and abhorring , landed world , is more oblivious than death . come hither ! put up thy gravestone , too , within the churchyard , and come hither , till we marry thee !\" hearkening to these voices , east and west , by early sunrise , and by fall of eve , the blacksmith \\' s soul responded , aye , i come ! and so perth went a - whaling . chapter 113 the forge . with matted beard , and swathed in a bristling shark - skin apron , about mid - day , perth was standing between his forge and anvil , the latter placed upon an iron - wood log , with one hand holding a pike - head in the coals , and with the other at his forge \\' s lungs , when captain ahab came along , carrying in his hand a small rusty - looking leathern bag . while yet a little distance from the forge , moody ahab paused ; till at last , perth , withdrawing his iron from the fire , began hammering it upon the anvil -- the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights , some of which flew close to ahab . \" are these thy mother carey \\' s chickens , perth ? they are always flying in thy wake ; birds of good omen , too , but not to all ;-- look here , they burn ; but thou -- thou liv \\' st among them without a scorch .\" \" because i am scorched all over , captain ahab ,\" answered perth , resting for a moment on his hammer ; \" i am past scorching ; not easily can \\' st thou scorch a scar .\" \" well , well ; no more . thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly , sanely woeful to me . in no paradise myself , i am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad . thou should \\' st go mad , blacksmith ; say , why dost thou not go mad ? how can \\' st thou endure without being mad ? do the heavens yet hate thee , that thou can \\' st not go mad ?-- what wert thou making there ?\" \" welding an old pike - head , sir ; there were seams and dents in it .\" \" and can \\' st thou make it all smooth again , blacksmith , after such hard usage as it had ?\" \" i think so , sir .\" \" and i suppose thou can \\' st smoothe almost any seams and dents ; never mind how hard the metal , blacksmith ?\" \" aye , sir , i think i can ; all seams and dents but one .\" \" look ye here , then ,\" cried ahab , passionately advancing , and leaning with both hands on perth \\' s shoulders ; \" look ye here -- here -- can ye smoothe out a seam like this , blacksmith ,\" sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow ; \" if thou could \\' st , blacksmith , glad enough would i lay my head upon thy anvil , and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes . answer ! can \\' st thou smoothe this seam ?\" \" oh ! that is the one , sir ! said i not all seams and dents but one ?\" \" aye , blacksmith , it is the one ; aye , man , it is unsmoothable ; for though thou only see \\' st it here in my flesh , it has worked down into the bone of my skull -- that is all wrinkles ! but , away with child \\' s play ; no more gaffs and pikes to - day . look ye here !\" jingling the leathern bag , as if it were full of gold coins . \" i , too , want a harpoon made ; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part , perth ; something that will stick in a whale like his own fin - bone . there \\' s the stuff ,\" flinging the pouch upon the anvil . \" look ye , blacksmith , these are the gathered nail - stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses .\" \" horse - shoe stubbs , sir ? why , captain ahab , thou hast here , then , the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work .\" \" i know it , old man ; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers . quick ! forge me the harpoon . and forge me first , twelve rods for its shank ; then wind , and twist , and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow - line . quick ! i \\' ll blow the fire .\" when at last the twelve rods were made , ahab tried them , one by one , by spiralling them , with his own hand , round a long , heavy iron bolt . \" a flaw !\" rejecting the last one . \" work that over again , perth .\" this done , perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one , when ahab stayed his hand , and said he would weld his own iron . as , then , with regular , gasping hems , he hammered on the anvil , perth passing to him the glowing rods , one after the other , and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame , the parsee passed silently , and bowing over his head towards the fire , seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil . but , as ahab looked up , he slid aside . \" what \\' s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for ?\" muttered stubb , looking on from the forecastle . \" that parsee smells fire like a fusee ; and smells of it himself , like a hot musket \\' s powder - pan .\" at last the shank , in one complete rod , received its final heat ; and as perth , to temper it , plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by , the scalding steam shot up into ahab \\' s bent face . \" would \\' st thou brand me , perth ?\" wincing for a moment with the pain ; \" have i been but forging my own branding - iron , then ?\" \" pray god , not that ; yet i fear something , captain ahab . is not this harpoon for the white whale ?\" \" for the white fiend ! but now for the barbs ; thou must make them thyself , man . here are my razors -- the best of steel ; here , and make the barbs sharp as the needle - sleet of the icy sea .\" for a moment , the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them . \" take them , man , i have no need for them ; for i now neither shave , sup , nor pray till -- but here -- to work !\" fashioned at last into an arrowy shape , and welded by perth to the shank , the steel soon pointed the end of the iron ; and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat , prior to tempering them , he cried to ahab to place the water - cask near . \" no , no -- no water for that ; i want it of the true death - temper . ahoy , there ! tashtego , queequeg , daggoo ! what say ye , pagans ! will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb ?\" holding it high up . a cluster of dark nods replied , yes . three punctures were made in the heathen flesh , and the white whale \\' s barbs were then tempered . \" ego non baptizo te in nomine patris , sed in nomine diaboli !\" deliriously howled ahab , as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood . now , mustering the spare poles from below , and selecting one of hickory , with the bark still investing it , ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron . a coil of new tow - line was then unwound , and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass , and stretched to a great tension . pressing his foot upon it , till the rope hummed like a harp - string , then eagerly bending over it , and seeing no strandings , ahab exclaimed , \" good ! and now for the seizings .\" at one extremity the rope was unstranded , and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon ; the pole was then driven hard up into the socket ; from the lower end the rope was traced half - way along the pole \\' s length , and firmly secured so , with intertwistings of twine . this done , pole , iron , and rope -- like the three fates -- remained inseparable , and ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon ; the sound of his ivory leg , and the sound of the hickory pole , both hollowly ringing along every plank . but ere he entered his cabin , light , unnatural , half - bantering , yet most piteous sound was heard . oh , pip ! thy wretched laugh , thy idle but unresting eye ; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship , and mocked it ! chapter 114 the gilder . penetrating further and further into the heart of the japanese cruising ground , the pequod was soon all astir in the fishery . often , in mild , pleasant weather , for twelve , fifteen , eighteen , and twenty hours on the stretch , they were engaged in the boats , steadily pulling , or sailing , or paddling after the whales , or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising ; though with but small success for their pains . at such times , under an abated sun ; afloat all day upon smooth , slow heaving swells ; seated in his boat , light as a birch canoe ; and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves , that like hearth - stone cats they purr against the gunwale ; these are the times of dreamy quietude , when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean \\' s skin , one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it ; and would not willingly remember , that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang . these are the times , when in his whale - boat the rover softly feels a certain filial , confident , land - like feeling towards the sea ; that he regards it as so much flowery earth ; and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts , seems struggling forward , not through high rolling waves , but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie : as when the western emigrants \\' horses only show their erected ears , while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure . the long - drawn virgin vales ; the mild blue hill - sides ; as over these there steals the hush , the hum ; you almost swear that play - wearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes , in some glad may - time , when the flowers of the woods are plucked . and all this mixes with your most mystic mood ; so that fact and fancy , half - way meeting , interpenetrate , and form one seamless whole . nor did such soothing scenes , however temporary , fail of at least as temporary an effect on ahab . but if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries , yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing . oh , grassy glades ! oh , ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul ; in ye ,-- though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life ,-- in ye , men yet may roll , like young horses in new morning clover ; and for some few fleeting moments , feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them . would to god these blessed calms would last . but the mingled , mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof : calms crossed by storms , a storm for every calm . there is no steady unretracing progress in this life ; we do not advance through fixed gradations , and at the last one pause :-- through infancy \\' s unconscious spell , boyhood \\' s thoughtless faith , adolescence \\' doubt ( the common doom ), then scepticism , then disbelief , resting at last in manhood \\' s pondering repose of if . but once gone through , we trace the round again ; and are infants , boys , and men , and ifs eternally . where lies the final harbor , whence we unmoor no more ? in what rapt ether sails the world , of which the weariest will never weary ? where is the foundling \\' s father hidden ? our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them : the secret of our paternity lies in their grave , and we must there to learn it . and that same day , too , gazing far down from his boat \\' s side into that same golden sea , starbuck lowly murmured :-- \" loveliness unfathomable , as ever lover saw in his young bride \\' s eye !-- tell me not of thy teeth - tiered sharks , and thy kidnapping cannibal ways . let faith oust fact ; let fancy oust memory ; i look deep down and do believe .\" and stubb , fish - like , with sparkling scales , leaped up in that same golden light :-- \" i am stubb , and stubb has his history ; but here stubb takes oaths that he has always been jolly !\" chapter 115 the pequod meets the bachelor . and jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind , some few weeks after ahab \\' s harpoon had been welded . it was a nantucket ship , the bachelor , which had just wedged in her last cask of oil , and bolted down her bursting hatches ; and now , in glad holiday apparel , was joyously , though somewhat vain - gloriously , sailing round among the widely - separated ships on the ground , previous to pointing her prow for home . the three men at her mast - head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats ; from the stern , a whale - boat was suspended , bottom down ; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain . signals , ensigns , and jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging , on every side . sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm ; above which , in her top - mast cross - trees , you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid ; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp . as was afterwards learned , the bachelor had met with the most surprising success ; all the more wonderful , for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish . not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm , but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for , from the ships she had met ; and these were stowed along the deck , and in the captain \\' s and officers \\' state - rooms . even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling - wood ; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil - butt , lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece . in the forecastle , the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests , and filled them ; it was humorously added , that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler , and filled it ; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee - pot and filled it ; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them ; that indeed everything was filled with sperm , except the captain \\' s pantaloons pockets , and those he reserved to thrust his hands into , in self - complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction . as this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod , the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle ; and drawing still nearer , a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try - pots , which , covered with the parchment - like poke or stomach skin of the black fish , gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew . on the quarter - deck , the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olive - hued girls who had eloped with them from the polynesian isles ; while suspended in an ornamented boat , firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast , three long island negroes , with glittering fiddle - bows of whale ivory , were presiding over the hilarious jig . meanwhile , others of the ship \\' s company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try - works , from which the huge pots had been removed . you would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed bastille , such wild cries they raised , as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea . lord and master over all this scene , the captain stood erect on the ship \\' s elevated quarter - deck , so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before him , and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion . and ahab , he too was standing on his quarter - deck , shaggy and black , with a stubborn gloom ; and as the two ships crossed each other \\' s wakes -- one all jubilations for things passed , the other all forebodings as to things to come -- their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene . \" come aboard , come aboard !\" cried the gay bachelor \\' s commander , lifting a glass and a bottle in the air . \" hast seen the white whale ?\" gritted ahab in reply . \" no ; only heard of him ; but don \\' t believe in him at all ,\" said the other good - humoredly . \" come aboard !\" \" thou art too damned jolly . sail on . hast lost any men ?\" \" not enough to speak of -- two islanders , that \\' s all ;-- but come aboard , old hearty , come along . i \\' ll soon take that black from your brow . come along , will ye ( merry \\' s the play ); a full ship and homeward - bound .\" \" how wondrous familiar is a fool !\" muttered ahab ; then aloud , \" thou art a full ship and homeward bound , thou sayst ; well , then , call me an empty ship , and outward - bound . so go thy ways , and i will mine . forward there ! set all sail , and keep her to the wind !\" and thus , while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze , the other stubbornly fought against it ; and so the two vessels parted ; the crew of the pequod looking with grave , lingering glances towards the receding bachelor ; but the bachelor \\' s men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in . and as ahab , leaning over the taffrail , eyed the homewardbound craft , he took from his pocket a small vial of sand , and then looking from the ship to the vial , seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together , for that vial was filled with nantucket soundings . chapter 116 the dying whale . not seldom in this life , when , on the right side , fortune \\' s favourites sail close by us , we , though all adroop before , catch somewhat of the rushing breeze , and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out . so seemed it with the pequod . for next day after encountering the gay bachelor , whales were seen and four were slain ; and one of them by ahab . it was far down the afternoon ; and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done : and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky , sun and whale both stilly died together ; then , such a sweetness and such plaintiveness , such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air , that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the manilla isles , the spanish land - breeze , wantonly turned sailor , had gone to sea , freighted with these vesper hymns . soothed again , but only soothed to deeper gloom , ahab , who had sterned off from the whale , sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat . for that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dying -- the turning sunwards of the head , and so expiring -- that strange spectacle , beheld of such a placid evening , somehow to ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before . \" he turns and turns him to it ,-- how slowly , but how steadfastly , his homage - rendering and invoking brow , with his last dying motions . he too worships fire ; most faithful , broad , baronial vassal of the sun !-- oh that these too - favouring eyes should see these too - favouring sights . look ! here , far water - locked ; beyond all hum of human weal or woe ; in these most candid and impartial seas ; where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets ; where for long chinese ages , the billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to , as stars that shine upon the niger \\' s unknown source ; here , too , life dies sunwards full of faith ; but see ! no sooner dead , than death whirls round the corpse , and it heads some other way . \" oh , thou dark hindoo half of nature , who of drowned bones hast builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas ; thou art an infidel , thou queen , and too truly speakest to me in the wide - slaughtering typhoon , and the hushed burial of its after calm . nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head , and then gone round again , without a lesson to me . \" oh , trebly hooped and welded hip of power ! oh , high aspiring , rainbowed jet !-- that one strivest , this one jettest all in vain ! in vain , oh whale , dost thou seek intercedings with yon all - quickening sun , that only calls forth life , but gives it not again . yet dost thou , darker half , rock me with a prouder , if a darker faith . all thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here ; i am buoyed by breaths of once living things , exhaled as air , but water now . \" then hail , for ever hail , o sea , in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl finds his only rest . born of earth , yet suckled by the sea ; though hill and valley mothered me , ye billows are my foster - brothers !\" chapter 117 the whale watch . the four whales slain that evening had died wide apart ; one , far to windward ; one , less distant , to leeward ; one ahead ; one astern . these last three were brought alongside ere nightfall ; but the windward one could not be reached till morning ; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night ; and that boat was ahab \\' s . the waif - pole was thrust upright into the dead whale \\' s spout - hole ; and the lantern hanging from its top , cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black , glossy back , and far out upon the midnight waves , which gently chafed the whale \\' s broad flank , like soft surf upon a beach . ahab and all his boat \\' s crew seemed asleep but the parsee ; who crouching in the bow , sat watching the sharks , that spectrally played round the whale , and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails . a sound like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of gomorrah , ran shuddering through the air . started from his slumbers , ahab , face to face , saw the parsee ; and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world . \" i have dreamed it again ,\" said he . \" of the hearses ? have i not said , old man , that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine ?\" \" and who are hearsed that die on the sea ?\" \" but i said , old man , that ere thou couldst die on this voyage , two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea ; the first not made by mortal hands ; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in america .\" \" aye , aye ! a strange sight that , parsee :-- a hearse and its plumes floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall - bearers . ha ! such a sight we shall not soon see .\" \" believe it or not , thou canst not die till it be seen , old man .\" \" and what was that saying about thyself ?\" \" though it come to the last , i shall still go before thee thy pilot .\" \" and when thou art so gone before -- if that ever befall -- then ere i can follow , thou must still appear to me , to pilot me still ?-- was it not so ? well , then , did i believe all ye say , oh my pilot ! i have here two pledges that i shall yet slay moby dick and survive it .\" \" take another pledge , old man ,\" said the parsee , as his eyes lighted up like fire - flies in the gloom --\" hemp only can kill thee .\" \" the gallows , ye mean .-- i am immortal then , on land and on sea ,\" cried ahab , with a laugh of derision ;--\" immortal on land and on sea !\" both were silent again , as one man . the grey dawn came on , and the slumbering crew arose from the boat \\' s bottom , and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship . chapter 118 the quadrant . the season for the line at length drew near ; and every day when ahab , coming from his cabin , cast his eyes aloft , the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes , and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces , and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon ; impatient for the order to point the ship \\' s prow for the equator . in good time the order came . it was hard upon high noon ; and ahab , seated in the bows of his high - hoisted boat , was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude . now , in that japanese sea , the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences . that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean \\' s immeasurable burning - glass . the sky looks lacquered ; clouds there are none ; the horizon floats ; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of god \\' s throne . well that ahab \\' s quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses , through which to take sight of that solar fire . so , swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship , and with his astrological - looking instrument placed to his eye , he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian . meantime while his whole attention was absorbed , the parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship \\' s deck , and with face thrown up like ahab \\' s , was eyeing the same sun with him ; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs , and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness . at length the desired observation was taken ; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg , ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant . then falling into a moment \\' s revery , he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself : \" thou sea - mark ! thou high and mighty pilot ! thou tellest me truly where i am -- but canst thou cast the least hint where i shall be ? or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living ? where is moby dick ? this instant thou must be eyeing him . these eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him ; aye , and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown , thither side of thee , thou sun !\" then gazing at his quadrant , and handling , one after the other , its numerous cabalistical contrivances , he pondered again , and muttered : \" foolish toy ! babies \\' plaything of haughty admirals , and commodores , and captains ; the world brags of thee , of thy cunning and might ; but what after all canst thou do , but tell the poor , pitiful point , where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet , and the hand that holds thee : no ! not one jot more ! thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be to - morrow noon ; and yet with thy impotence thou insultest the sun ! science ! curse thee , thou vain toy ; and cursed be all the things that cast man \\' s eyes aloft to that heaven , whose live vividness but scorches him , as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light , o sun ! level by nature to this earth \\' s horizon are the glances of man \\' s eyes ; not shot from the crown of his head , as if god had meant him to gaze on his firmament . curse thee , thou quadrant !\" dashing it to the deck , \" no longer will i guide my earthly way by thee ; the level ship \\' s compass , and the level deadreckoning , by log and by line ; these shall conduct me , and show me my place on the sea . aye ,\" lighting from the boat to the deck , \" thus i trample on thee , thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high ; thus i split and destroy thee !\" as the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet , a sneering triumph that seemed meant for ahab , and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself -- these passed over the mute , motionless parsee \\' s face . unobserved he rose and glided away ; while , awestruck by the aspect of their commander , the seamen clustered together on the forecastle , till ahab , troubledly pacing the deck , shouted out --\" to the braces ! up helm !-- square in !\" in an instant the yards swung round ; and as the ship half - wheeled upon her heel , her three firm - seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long , ribbed hull , seemed as the three horatii pirouetting on one sufficient steed . standing between the knight - heads , starbuck watched the pequod \\' s tumultuous way , and ahab \\' s also , as he went lurching along the deck . \" i have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow , full of its tormented flaming life ; and i have seen it wane at last , down , down , to dumbest dust . old man of oceans ! of all this fiery life of thine , what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes !\" \" aye ,\" cried stubb , \" but sea - coal ashes -- mind ye that , mr . starbuck -- sea - coal , not your common charcoal . well , well ; i heard ahab mutter , \\' here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine ; swears that i must play them , and no others .\\' and damn me , ahab , but thou actest right ; live in the game , and die in it !\" chapter 119 the candles . warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs : the tiger of bengal crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure . skies the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders : gorgeous cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands . so , too , it is , that in these resplendent japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms , the typhoon . it will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky , like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town . towards evening of that day , the pequod was torn of her canvas , and bare - poled was left to fight a typhoon which had struck her directly ahead . when darkness came on , sky and sea roared and split with the thunder , and blazed with the lightning , that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after sport . holding by a shroud , starbuck was standing on the quarter - deck ; at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft , to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there ; while stubb and flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats . but all their pains seemed naught . though lifted to the very top of the cranes , the windward quarter boat ( ahab \\' s ) did not escape . a great rolling sea , dashing high up against the reeling ship \\' s high teetering side , stove in the boat \\' s bottom at the stern , and left it again , all dripping through like a sieve . \" bad work , bad work ! mr . starbuck ,\" said stubb , regarding the wreck , \" but the sea will have its way . stubb , for one , can \\' t fight it . you see , mr . starbuck , a wave has such a great long start before it leaps , all round the world it runs , and then comes the spring ! but as for me , all the start i have to meet it , is just across the deck here . but never mind ; it \\' s all in fun : so the old song says ;\"--( sings .) oh ! jolly is the gale , and a joker is the whale , a \\' flourishin \\' his tail ,-- such a funny , sporty , gamy , jesty , joky , hoky - poky lad , is the ocean , oh ! the scud all a flyin \\', that \\' s his flip only foamin \\'; when he stirs in the spicin \\',-- such a funny , sporty , gamy , jesty , joky , hoky - poky lad , is the ocean , oh ! thunder splits the ships , but he only smacks his lips , a tastin \\' of this flip ,-- such a funny , sporty , gamy , jesty , joky , hoky - poky lad , is the ocean , oh ! \" avast stubb ,\" cried starbuck , \" let the typhoon sing , and strike his harp here in our rigging ; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace .\" \" but i am not a brave man ; never said i was a brave man ; i am a coward ; and i sing to keep up my spirits . and i tell you what it is , mr . starbuck , there \\' s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat . and when that \\' s done , ten to one i sing ye the doxology for a wind - up .\" \" madman ! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own .\" \" what ! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else , never mind how foolish ?\" \" here !\" cried starbuck , seizing stubb by the shoulder , and pointing his hand towards the weather bow , \" markest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward , the very course ahab is to run for moby dick ? the very course he swung to this day noon ? now mark his boat there ; where is that stove ? in the stern - sheets , man ; where he is wont to stand -- his stand - point is stove , man ! now jump overboard , and sing away , if thou must ! \" i don \\' t half understand ye : what \\' s in the wind ?\" \" yes , yes , round the cape of good hope is the shortest way to nantucket ,\" soliloquized starbuck suddenly , heedless of stubb \\' s question . \" the gale that now hammers at us to stave us , we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home . yonder , to windward , all is blackness of doom ; but to leeward , homeward -- i see it lightens up there ; but not with the lightning .\" at that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness , following the flashes , a voice was heard at his side ; and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead . \" who \\' s there ?\" \" old thunder !\" said ahab , groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot - hole ; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire . now , as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil ; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast , is intended to conduct it into the water . but as this conductor must descend to considerable depth , that its end may avoid all contact with the hull ; and as moreover , if kept constantly towing there , it would be liable to many mishaps , besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging , and more or less impeding the vessel \\' s way in the water ; because of all this , the lower parts of a ship \\' s lightning - rods are not always overboard ; but are generally made in long slender links , so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside , or thrown down into the sea , as occasion may require . \" the rods ! the rods !\" cried starbuck to the crew , suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux , to light ahab to his post . \" are they overboard ? drop them over , fore and aft . quick !\" \" avast !\" cried ahab ; \" let \\' s have fair play here , though we be the weaker side . yet i \\' ll contribute to raise rods on the himmalehs and andes , that all the world may be secured ; but out on privileges ! let them be , sir .\" \" look aloft !\" cried starbuck . \" the corpusants ! the corpusants ! all the yard - arms were tipped with a pallid fire ; and touched at each tri - pointed lightning - rod - end with three tapering white flames , each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air , like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar . \" blast the boat ! let it go !\" cried stubb at this instant , as a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft , so that its gunwale violently jammed his hand , as he was passing a lashing . \" blast it !\"-- but slipping backward on the deck , his uplifted eyes caught the flames ; and immediately shifting his tone he cried --\" the corpusants have mercy on us all !\" to sailors , oaths are household words ; they will swear in the trance of the calm , and in the teeth of the tempest ; they will imprecate curses from the topsail - yard - arms , when most they teeter over to a seething sea ; but in all my voyagings , seldom have i heard a common oath when god \\' s burning finger has been laid on the ship ; when his \" mene , mene , tekel upharsin \" has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage . while this pallidness was burning aloft , few words were heard from the enchanted crew ; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle , all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence , like a far away constellation of stars . relieved against the ghostly light , the gigantic jet negro , daggoo , loomed up to thrice his real stature , and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come . the parted mouth of tashtego revealed his shark - white teeth , which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants ; while lit up by the preternatural light , queequeg \\' s tattooing burned like satanic blue flames on his body . the tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft ; and once more the pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall . a moment or two passed , when starbuck , going forward , pushed against some one . it was stubb . \" what thinkest thou now , man ; i heard thy cry ; it was not the same in the song .\" \" no , no , it wasn \\' t ; i said the corpusants have mercy on us all ; and i hope they will , still . but do they only have mercy on long faces ?-- have they no bowels for a laugh ? and look ye , mr . starbuck -- but it \\' s too dark to look . hear me , then : i take that mast - head flame we saw for a sign of good luck ; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a \\' block with sperm - oil , d \\' ye see ; and so , all that sperm will work up into the masts , like sap in a tree . yes , our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles -- that \\' s the good promise we saw .\" at that moment starbuck caught sight of stubb \\' s face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight . glancing upwards , he cried : \" see ! see !\" and once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor . \" the corpusants have mercy on us all ,\" cried stubb , again . at the base of the mainmast , full beneath the doubloon and the flame , the parsee was kneeling in ahab \\' s front , but with his head bowed away from him ; while near by , from the arched and overhanging rigging , where they had just been engaged securing a spar , a number of the seamen , arrested by the glare , now cohered together , and hung pendulous , like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping , orchard twig . in various enchanted attitudes , like the standing , or stepping , or running skeletons in herculaneum , others remained rooted to the deck ; but all their eyes upcast . \" aye , aye , men !\" cried ahab . \" look up at it ; mark it well ; the white flame but lights the way to the white whale ! hand me those mainmast links there ; i would fain feel this pulse , and let mine beat against it ; blood against fire ! so .\" then turning -- the last link held fast in his left hand , he put his foot upon the parsee ; and with fixed upward eye , and high - flung right arm , he stood erect before the lofty tri - pointed trinity of flames . \" oh ! thou clear spirit of clear fire , whom on these seas i as persian once did worship , till in the sacramental act so burned by thee , that to this hour i bear the scar ; i now know thee , thou clear spirit , and i now know that thy right worship is defiance . to neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind ; and e \\' en for hate thou canst but kill ; and all are killed . no fearless fool now fronts thee . i own thy speechless , placeless power ; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional , unintegral mastery in me . in the midst of the personified impersonal , a personality stands here . though but a point at best ; whencesoe \\' er i came ; wheresoe \\' er i go ; yet while i earthly live , the queenly personality lives in me , and feels her royal rights . but war is pain , and hate is woe . come in thy lowest form of love , and i will kneel and kiss thee ; but at thy highest , come as mere supernal power ; and though thou launchest navies of full - freighted worlds , there \\' s that in here that still remains indifferent . oh , thou clear spirit , of thy fire thou madest me , and like a true child of fire , i breathe it back to thee .\" [ sudden , repeated flashes of lightning ; the nine flames leap lengthwise to thrice their previous height ; ahab , with the rest , closes his eyes , his right hand pressed hard upon them .] \" i own thy speechless , placeless power ; said i not so ? nor was it wrung from me ; nor do i now drop these links . thou canst blind ; but i can then grope . thou canst consume ; but i can then be ashes . take the homage of these poor eyes , and shutter - hands . i would not take it . the lightning flashes through my skull ;

i burn with thee ; would fain be welded with thee ; defyingly i worship thee !\" \" the boat ! the boat !\" cried starbuck , \" look at thy boat , old man !\" ahab \\' s harpoon , the one forged at perth \\' s fire , remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch , so that it projected beyond his whale - boat \\' s bow ; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off ; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale , forked fire . as the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent \\' s tongue , starbuck grasped ahab by the arm --\" god , god is against thee , old man ; forbear ! \\' tis an ill voyage ! ill begun , ill continued ; let me square the yards , while we may , old man , and make a fair wind of it homewards , to go on a better voyage than this .\" overhearing starbuck , the panic - stricken crew instantly ran to the braces -- though not a sail was left aloft . for the moment all the aghast mate \\' s thoughts seemed theirs ; they raised a half mutinous cry . but dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck , and snatching the burning harpoon , ahab waved it like a torch among them ; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope \\' s end . petrified by his aspect , and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held , the men fell back in dismay , and ahab again spoke :-- \" all your oaths to hunt the white whale are as binding as mine ; and heart , soul , and body , lungs and life , old ahab is bound . and that ye may know to what tune this heart beats ; look ye here ; thus i blow out the last fear !\" and with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame . as in the hurricane that sweeps the plain , men fly the neighborhood of some lone , gigantic elm , whose very height and strength but render it so much the more unsafe , because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts ; so at those last words of ahab \\' s many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay . chapter 120 the deck towards the end of the first night watch . ahab standing by the helm . starbuck approaching him . we must send down the main - top - sail yard , sir . the band is working loose and the lee lift is half - stranded . shall i strike it , sir ?\" \" strike nothing ;

you may pound that knot there as much as you please , but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying . and how long ago is it since you said the very contrary ? didn \\' t you once say that whatever ship ahab sails in , that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy , just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward ? stop , now ; didn \\' t you say so ?\" \" well , suppose i did ? what then ? i \\' ve part changed my flesh since that time , why not my mind ? besides , supposing we are loaded with powder barrels aft and lucifers forward ;

might fill pitchers at your coat collar . don \\' t you see , then , that for these extra risks the marine insurance companies have extra guarantees ? here are hydrants , flask . but hark , again , and i \\' ll answer ye the other thing . first take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here , though , so i can pass the rope ; now listen . what \\' s the mighty difference between holding a mast \\' s lightning - rod in the storm , and standing close by a mast that hasn \\' t got any lightning - rod at all in a storm ? don \\' t you see , you timber - head , that no harm can come to the holder of the rod , unless the mast is first struck ? what are you talking about , then ? not one ship in a hundred carries rods , and ahab ,-- aye , man , and all of us ,-- were in no more danger then , in my poor opinion , than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas . why , you king - post , you , i suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small lightning - rod running up the corner of his hat , like a militia officer \\' s skewered feather , and trailing behind like his sash . why don \\' t ye be sensible , flask ? it \\' s easy to be sensible ; why don \\' t ye , then ? any man with half an eye can be sensible .\" \" i don \\' t know that , stubb . you sometimes find it rather hard .\" \" yes , when a fellow \\' s soaked through , it \\' s hard to be sensible , that \\' s a fact . and i am about drenched with this spray . never mind ; catch the turn there , and pass it . seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again . tying these two anchors here , flask , seems like tying a man \\' s hands behind him . and what big generous hands they are , to be sure . these are your iron fists , hey ? what a hold they have , too ! i wonder , flask , whether the world is anchored anywhere ; if she is , she swings with an uncommon long cable , though . there , hammer that knot down , and we \\' ve done . so ; next to touching land , lighting on deck is the most satisfactory . i say , just wring out my jacket skirts , will ye ? thank ye . they laugh at long - togs so , flask ; but seems to me , a long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat . the tails tapering down that way , serve to carry off the water , d \\' ye see . same with cocked hats ; the cocks form gable - end eave - troughs , flask . no more monkey - jackets and tarpaulins for me ; i must mount a swallow - tail , and drive down a beaver ; so . halloa ! whew ! there goes my tarpaulin overboard ; lord , lord , that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly ! this is a nasty night , lad .\" chapter 122 midnight aloft .-- thunder and lightning . the main - top - sail yard .-- tashtego passing new lashings around it . \" um , um , um . stop that thunder ! plenty too much thunder up here . what \\' s the use of thunder ? um , um , um . we don \\' t want thunder ; we want rum ; give us a glass of rum . um , um , um !\" chapter 123 the musket . during the most violent shocks of the typhoon , the man at the pequod \\' s jaw - bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic motions , even though preventer tackles had been attached to it -- for they were slack -- because some play to the tiller was indispensable . in a severe gale like this , while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast , it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses , at intervals , go round and round . it was thus with the pequod \\' s ; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards ; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion . some hours after midnight , the typhoon abated so much , that through the strenuous exertions of starbuck and stubb -- one engaged forward and the other aft -- the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main - top - sails were cut adrift from the spars , and went eddying away to leeward , like the feathers of an albatross , which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm - tossed bird is on the wing . the three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed , and a storm - trysail was set further aft ; so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again ; and the course -- for the present , east - south - east -- which he was to steer , if practicable , was once more given to the helmsman . for during the violence of the gale , he had only steered according to its vicissitudes . but as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible , watching the compass meanwhile , lo ! a good sign ! the wind seemed coming round astern ; aye , the foul breeze became fair ! instantly the yards were squared , to the lively song of \" ho ! the fair wind ! oh - ye - ho , cheerly men !\" the crew singing for joy , that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it . in compliance with the standing order of his commander -- to report immediately , and at any one of the twenty - four hours , any decided change in the affairs of the deck ,-- starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze -- however reluctantly and gloomily ,-- than he mechanically went below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance . ere knocking at his state - room , he involuntarily paused before it a moment . the cabin lamp -- taking long swings this way and that -- was burning fitfully , and casting fitful shadows upon the old man \\' s bolted door ,-- a thin one , with fixed blinds inserted , in place of upper panels . the isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there , though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements . the loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed , as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead . starbuck was an honest , upright man ; but out of starbuck \\' s heart , at that instant when he saw the muskets , there strangely evolved an evil thought ; but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself . \" he would have shot me once ,\" he murmured , \" yes , there \\' s the very musket that he pointed at me ;-- that one with the studded stock ; let me touch it -- lift it . strange , that i , who have handled so many deadly lances , strange , that i should shake so now . loaded ? i must see . aye , aye ; and powder in the pan ;-- that \\' s not good . best spill it ?-- wait . i \\' ll cure myself of this . i \\' ll hold the musket boldly while i think .-- i come to report a fair wind to him . but how fair ? fair for death and doom ,-- that \\' s fair for moby dick . it \\' s a fair wind that \\' s only fair for that accursed fish .-- the very tube he pointed at me !-- the very one ; this one -- i hold it here ; he would have killed me with the very thing i handle now .-- aye and he would fain kill all his crew . does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale ? has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant ? and in these same perilous seas , gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error - abounding log ? and in this very typhoon , did he not swear that he would have no lightning - rods ? but shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship \\' s company down to doom with him ?-- yes , it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more , if this ship come to any deadly harm ; and come to deadly harm , my soul swears this ship will , if ahab have his way . if , then , he were this instant -- put aside , that crime would not be his . ha ! is he muttering in his sleep ? yes , just there ,-- in there , he \\' s sleeping . sleeping ? aye , but still alive , and soon awake again . i can \\' t withstand thee , then , old man . not reasoning ; not remonstrance ; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to ; all this thou scornest . flat obedience to thy own flat commands , this is all thou breathest . aye , and say \\' st the men have vow \\' d thy vow ; say \\' st all of us are ahabs . great god forbid !-- but is there no other way ? no lawful way ?-- make him a prisoner to be taken home ? what ! hope to wrest this old man \\' s living power from his own living hands ? only a fool would try it . say he were pinioned even ; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers ; chained down to ring - bolts on this cabin floor ; he would be more hideous than a caged tiger , then . i could not endure the sight ; could not possibly fly his howlings ; all comfort , sleep itself , inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage . what , then , remains ? the land is hundreds of leagues away , and locked japan the nearest . i stand alone here upon an open sea , with two oceans and a whole continent between me and law .-- aye , aye , \\' tis so .-- is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would - be murderer in his bed , tindering sheets and skin together ?-- and would i be a murderer , then , if \"-- and slowly , stealthily , and half sideways looking , he placed the loaded musket \\' s end against the door . \" on this level , ahab \\' s hammock swings within ; his head this way . a touch , and starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again .-- oh mary ! mary !-- boy ! boy ! boy !-- but if i wake thee not to death , old man , who can tell to what unsounded deeps starbuck \\' s body this day week may sink , with all the crew ! great god , where art thou ? shall i ? shall i ?-- the wind has gone down and shifted , sir ; the fore and main topsails are reefed and set ; she heads her course .\" \" stern all ! oh moby dick , i clutch thy heart at last !\" such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man \\' s tormented sleep , as if starbuck \\' s voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak . the yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard \\' s arm against the panel ; starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel ; but turning from the door , he placed the death - tube in its rack , and left the place . \" he \\' s too sound asleep , mr . stubb ; go thou down , and wake him , and tell him . i must see to the deck here . thou know \\' st what to say .\" chapter 124 the needle . next morning the not - yet - subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty bulk , and striving in the pequod \\' s gurgling track , pushed her on like giants \\' palms outspread . the strong , unstaggering breeze abounded so , that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails ; the whole world boomed before the wind . muffled in the full morning light , the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place ; where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks . emblazonings , as of crowned babylonian kings and queens , reigned over everything . the sea was as a crucible of molten gold , that bubblingly leaps with light and heat . long maintaining an enchanted silence , ahab stood apart ; and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit , he turned to eye the bright sun \\' s rays produced ahead ; and when she profoundly settled by the stern , he turned behind , and saw the sun \\' s rearward place , and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake . \" ha , ha , my ship ! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea - chariot of the sun . ho , ho ! all ye nations before my prow , i bring the sun to ye ! yoke on the further billows ; hallo ! a tandem , i drive the sea !\" but suddenly reined back by some counter thought , he hurried towards the helm , huskily demanding how the ship was heading . \" east - sou - east , sir ,\" said the frightened steersman . \" thou liest !\" smiting him with his clenched fist . \" heading east at this hour in the morning , and the sun astern ?\" upon this every soul was confounded ; for the phenomenon just then observed by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else ; but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause . thrusting his head half way into the binnacle , ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses ; his uplifted arm slowly fell ; for a moment he almost seemed to stagger . standing behind him starbuck looked , and lo ! the two compasses pointed east , and the pequod was as infallibly going west . but ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew , the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed , \" i have it ! it has happened before . mr . starbuck , last night \\' s thunder turned our compasses -- that \\' s all . thou hast before now heard of such a thing , i take it .\" \" aye ; but never before has it happened to me , sir ,\" said the pale mate , gloomily . here , it must needs be said , that accidents like this have in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms . the magnetic energy , as developed in the mariner \\' s needle , is , as all know , essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven ; hence it is not to be much marvelled at , that such things should be . instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel , so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging , the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal ; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated , so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife \\' s knitting needle . but in either case , the needle never again , of itself , recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost ; and if the binnacle compasses be affected , the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship ; even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson . deliberately standing before the binnacle , and eyeing the transpointed compasses , the old man , with the sharp of his extended hand , now took the precise bearing of the sun , and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted , shouted out his orders for the ship \\' s course to be changed accordingly . the yards were hard up ; and once more the pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind , for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her . meanwhile , whatever were his own secret thoughts , starbuck said nothing , but quietly he issued all requisite orders ; while stubb and flask -- who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings -- likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced . as for the men , though some of them lowly rumbled , their fear of ahab was greater than their fear of fate . but as ever before , the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed ; or if impressed , it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible ahab \\' s . for a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries . but chancing to slip with his ivory heel , he saw the crushed copper sight - tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck . \" thou poor , proud heaven - gazer and sun \\' s pilot ! yesterday i wrecked thee , and to - day the compasses would fain have wrecked me . so , so . but ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet . mr . starbuck -- a lance without a pole ; a top - maul , and the smallest of the sail - maker \\' s needles . quick !\" accessory , perhaps , to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do , were certain prudential motives , whose object might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill , in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses . besides , the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles , though clumsily practicable , was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors , without some shudderings and evil portents . \" men ,\" said he , steadily turning upon the crew , as the mate handed him the things he had demanded , \" my men , the thunder turned old ahab \\' s needles ; but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own , that will point as true as any .\" abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors , as this was said ; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow . but starbuck looked away . with a blow from the top - maul ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance , and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining , bade him hold it upright , without its touching the deck . then , with the maul , after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod , he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it , and less strongly hammered that , several times , the mate still holding the rod as before . then going through some small strange motions with it -- whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel , or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew , is uncertain -- he called for linen thread ; and moving to the binnacle , slipped out the two reversed needles there , and horizontally suspended the sail - needle by its middle , over one of the compass - cards . at first , the steel went round and round , quivering and vibrating at either end ; but at last it settled to its place , when ahab , who had been intently watching for this result , stepped frankly back from the binnacle , and pointing his stretched arm towards it , exclaimed ,--\" look ye , for yourselves , if ahab be not lord of the level loadstone ! the sun is east , and that compass swears it !\" one after another they peered in , for nothing but their own eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs , and one after another they slunk away . in his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph , you then saw ahab in all his fatal pride . chapter 125 the log and line . while now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage , the log and line had but very seldom been in use . owing to a confident reliance upon other means of determining the vessel \\' s place , some merchantmen , and many whalemen , especially when cruising , wholly neglect to heave the log ; though at the same time , and frequently more for form \\' s sake than anything else , regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship , as well as the presumed average rate of progression every hour . it had been thus with the pequod . the wooden reel and angular log attached hung , long untouched , just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks . rains and spray had damped it ; sun and wind had warped it ; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly . but heedless of all this , his mood seized ahab , as he happened to glance upon the reel , not many hours after the magnet scene , and he remembered how his quadrant was no more , and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line . the ship was sailing plungingly ; astern the billows rolled in riots . \" forward , there ! heave the log !\" two seamen came . the golden - hued tahitian and the grizzly manxman . \" take the reel , one of ye , i \\' ll heave .\" they went towards the extreme stern , on the ship \\' s lee side , where the deck , with the oblique energy of the wind , was now almost dipping into the creamy , sidelong - rushing sea . the manxman took the reel , and holding it high up , by the projecting handle - ends of the spindle , round which the spool of line revolved , so stood with the angular log hanging downwards , till ahab advanced to him . ahab stood before him , and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary hand - coil to toss overboard , when the old manxman , who was intently eyeing both him and the line , made bold to speak . \" sir , i mistrust it ; this line looks far gone , long heat and wet have spoiled it .\" \"\\' twill hold , old gentleman . long heat and wet , have they spoiled thee ? thou seem \\' st to hold . or , truer perhaps , life holds thee ; not thou it .\" \" i hold the spool , sir . but just as my captain says . with these grey hairs of mine \\' tis not worth while disputing , \\' specially with a superior , who \\' ll ne \\' er confess .\" \" what \\' s that ? there now \\' s a patched professor in queen nature \\' s granite - founded college ; but methinks he \\' s too subservient . where wert thou born ?\" \" in the little rocky isle of man , sir .\" \" excellent ! thou \\' st hit the world by that .\" \" i know not , sir , but i was born there .\" \" in the isle of man , hey ? well , the other way , it \\' s good . here \\' s a man from man ; a man born in once independent man , and now unmanned of man ; which is sucked in -- by what ? up with the reel ! the dead , blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last . up with it ! so .\" the log was heaved . the loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging line astern , and then , instantly , the reel began to whirl . in turn , jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows , the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely . \" hold hard !\" snap ! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon ; the tugging log was gone . \" i crush the quadrant , the thunder turns the needles , and now the mad sea parts the log - line . but ahab can mend all . haul in here , tahitian ; reel up , manxman . and look ye , let the carpenter make another log , and mend thou the line . see to it .\" \" there he goes now ; to him nothing \\' s happened ; but to me , the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world . haul in , haul in , tahitian ! these lines run whole , and whirling out : come in broken , and dragging slow . ha , pip ? come to help ; eh , pip ?\" \" pip ? whom call ye pip ? pip jumped from the whale - boat . pip \\' s missing . let \\' s see now if ye haven \\' t fished him up here , fisherman . it drags hard ; i guess he \\' s holding on . jerk him , tahiti ! jerk him off ; we haul in no cowards here . ho ! there \\' s his arm just breaking water . a hatchet ! a hatchet ! cut it off -- we haul in no cowards here . captain ahab ! sir , sir ! here \\' s pip , trying to get on board again .\" \" peace , thou crazy loon ,\" cried the manxman , seizing him by the arm . \" away from the quarter - deck !\" \" the greater idiot ever scolds the lesser ,\" muttered ahab , advancing . \" hands off from that holiness ! where sayest thou pip was , boy ? \" astern there , sir , astern ! lo ! lo !\" \" and who art thou , boy ? i see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy eyes . oh god ! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve through ! who art thou , boy ?\" \" bell - boy , sir ;

the pequod held on her path towards the equator . making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters , descrying no ships , and ere long , sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds , over waves monotonously mild ; all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene . at last , when the ship drew near to the outskirts , as it were , of the equatorial fishing - ground , and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn , was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets ; the watch -- then headed by flask -- was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly -- like half - articulated wailings of the ghosts of all herod \\' s murdered innocents -- that one and all , they started from their reveries , and for the space of some moments stood , or sat , or leaned all transfixedly listening , like the carved roman slave , while that wild cry remained within hearing . the christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids , and shuddered ; but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled . yet the grey manxman -- the oldest mariner of all -- declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard , were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea . below in his hammock , ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn , when he came to the deck ; it was then recounted to him by flask , not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings . he hollowly laughed , and thus explained the wonder . those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals , and some young seals that had lost their dams , or some dams that had lost their cubs , must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her , crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail . but this only the more affected some of them , because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals , arising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress , but also from the human look of their round heads and semi - intelligent faces , seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside . in the sea , under certain circumstances , seals have more than once been mistaken for men . but the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning . at sun - rise this man went from his hammock to his mast - head at the fore ; and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep ( for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state ), whether it was thus with the man , there is now no telling ; but , be that as it may , he had not been long at his perch , when a cry was heard -- a cry and a rushing -- and looking up , they saw a falling phantom in the air ; and looking down , a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea . the life - buoy -- a long slender cask -- was dropped from the stern , where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring ; but no hand rose to seize it , and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken , so that it slowly filled , and that parched wood also filled at its every pore ; and the studded iron - bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom , as if to yield him his pillow , though in sooth but a hard one . and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the white whale , on the white whale \\' s own peculiar ground ; that man was swallowed up in the deep . but few , perhaps , thought of that at the time . indeed , in some sort , they were not grieved at this event , at least as a portent ; for they regarded it , not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future , but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged . they declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before . but again the old manxman said nay . the lost life - buoy was now to be replaced ; starbuck was directed to see to it ; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found , and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage , all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end , whatever that might prove to be ; therefore , they were going to leave the ship \\' s stern unprovided with a buoy , when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin . \" a life - buoy of a coffin !\" cried starbuck , starting . \" rather queer , that , i should say ,\" said stubb . \" it will make a good enough one ,\" said flask , \" the carpenter here can arrange it easily .\" \" bring it up ; there \\' s nothing else for it ,\" said starbuck , after a melancholy pause . \" rig it , carpenter ; do not look at me so -- the coffin , i mean . dost thou hear me ? rig it .\" \" and shall i nail down the lid , sir ?\" moving his hand as with a hammer . \" aye .\" \" and shall i caulk the seams , sir ?\" moving his hand as with a caulking - iron . \" aye .\" \" and shall i then pay over the same with pitch , sir ?\" moving his hand as with a pitch - pot . \" away ! what possesses thee to this ? make a life - buoy of the coffin , and no more .-- mr . stubb , mr . flask , come forward with me .\" \" he goes off in a huff . the whole he can endure ; at the parts he baulks . now i don \\' t like this . i make a leg for captain ahab , and he wears it like a gentleman ; but i make a bandbox for queequeg , and he won \\' t put his head into it . are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin ? and now i \\' m ordered to make a life - buoy of it . it \\' s like turning an old coat ; going to bring the flesh on the other side now . i don \\' t like this cobbling sort of business -- i don \\' t like it at all ; it \\' s undignified ; it \\' s not my place . let tinkers \\' brats do tinkerings ; we are their betters . i like to take in hand none but clean , virgin , fair - and - square mathematical jobs , something that regularly begins at the beginning , and is at the middle when midway , and comes to an end at the conclusion ; not a cobbler \\' s job , that \\' s at an end in the middle , and at the beginning at the end . it \\' s the old woman \\' s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs . lord ! what an affection all old women have for tinkers . i know an old woman of sixty - five who ran away with a bald - headed young tinker once . and that \\' s the reason i never would work for lonely widow old women ashore , when i kept my job - shop in the vineyard ; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me . but heigh - ho ! there are no caps at sea but snow - caps . let me see . nail down the lid ; caulk the seams ; pay over the same with pitch ; batten them down tight , and hang it with the snap - spring over the ship \\' s stern . were ever such things done before with a coffin ? some superstitious old carpenters , now , would be tied up in the rigging , ere they would do the job . but i \\' m made of knotty aroostook hemlock ; i don \\' t budge . cruppered with a coffin ! sailing about with a grave - yard tray ! but never mind . we workers in woods make bridal - bedsteads and card - tables , as well as coffins and hearses . we work by the month , or by the job , or by the profit ; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work , unless it be too confounded cobbling , and then we stash it if we can . hem ! i \\' ll do the job , now , tenderly . i \\' ll have me -- let \\' s see -- how many in the ship \\' s company , all told ? but i \\' ve forgotten . any way , i \\' ll have me thirty separate , turk \\' s - headed life - lines , each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin . then , if the hull go down , there \\' ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin , a sight not seen very often beneath the sun ! come hammer , caulking - iron , pitch - pot , and marling - spike ! let \\' s to it .\" chapter 127 the deck . the coffin laid upon two line - tubs , between the vice - bench and the open hatchway ;

but as the broad - winged windward stranger shot nigh to her , the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst , and all life fled from the smitten hull . \" bad news ; she brings bad news ,\" muttered the old manxman . but ere her commander , who , with trumpet to mouth , stood up in his boat ; ere he could hopefully hail , ahab \\' s voice was heard . \" hast seen the white whale ?\" \" aye , yesterday . have ye seen a whale - boat adrift ?\" throttling his joy , ahab negatively answered this unexpected question ; and would then have fain boarded the stranger , when the stranger captain himself , having stopped his vessel \\' s way , was seen descending her side . a few keen pulls , and his boat - hook soon clinched the pequod \\' s main - chains , and he sprang to the deck . immediately he was recognised by ahab for a nantucketer he knew . but no formal salutation was exchanged . \" where was he ?-- not killed !-- not killed !\" cried ahab , closely advancing . \" how was it ?\" it seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous , while three of the stranger \\' s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales , which had led them some four or five miles from the ship ; and while they were yet in swift chase to windward , the white hump and head of moby dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water , not very far to leeward ; whereupon , the fourth rigged boat -- a reserved one -- had been instantly lowered in chase . after a keen sail before the wind , this fourth boat -- the swiftest keeled of all -- seemed to have succeeded in fastening -- at least , as well as the man at the mast - head could tell anything about it . in the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat ; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water ; and after that nothing more ; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers , as often happens . there was some apprehension , but no positive alarm , as yet . the recall signals were placed in the rigging ; darkness came on ; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats -- ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction -- the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight , but , for the time , to increase her distance from it . but the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard , she crowded all sail -- stunsail on stunsail -- after the missing boat ; kindling a fire in her try - pots for a beacon ; and every other man aloft on the look - out . but though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen ; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her ; and not finding anything , had again dashed on ; again paused , and lowered her boats ; and though she had thus continued doing till daylight ; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen . the story told , the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal his object in boarding the pequod . he desired that ship to unite with his own in the search ; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart , on parallel lines , and so sweeping a double horizon , as it were . \" i will wager something now ,\" whispered stubb to flask , \" that some one in that missing boat wore off that captain \\' s best coat ; mayhap , his watch -- he \\' s so cursed anxious to get it back . who ever heard of two pious whale - ships cruising after one missing whale - boat in the height of the whaling season ? see , flask , only see how pale he looks -- pale in the very buttons of his eyes -- look -- it wasn \\' t the coat -- it must have been the --\" \" my boy , my own boy is among them . for god \\' s sake -- i beg , i conjure \"-- here exclaimed the stranger captain to ahab , who thus far had but icily received his petition . \" for eight - and - forty hours let me charter your ship -- i will gladly pay for it , and roundly pay for it -- if there be no other way -- for eight - and - forty hours only -- only that -- you must , oh , you must , and you shall do this thing .\" \" his son !\" cried stubb , \" oh , it \\' s his son he \\' s lost ! i take back the coat and watch -- what says ahab ? we must save that boy .\" \" he \\' s drowned with the rest on \\' em , last night ,\" said the old manx sailor standing behind them ; \" i heard ; all of ye heard their spirits .\" now , as it shortly turned out , what made this incident of the rachel \\' s the more melancholy , was the circumstance , that not only was one of the captain \\' s sons among the number of the missing boat \\' s crew ; but among the number of the other boat \\' s crews , at the same time , but on the other hand , separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase , there had been still another son ; as that for a time , the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity ; which was only solved for him by his chief mate \\' s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale - ship in such emergencies , that is , when placed between jeopardized but divided boats , always to pick up the majority first . but the captain , for some unknown constitutional reason , had refrained from mentioning all this , and not till forced to it by ahab \\' s iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy ; a little lad , but twelve years old , whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a nantucketer \\' s paternal love , had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race . nor does it unfrequently occur , that nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them , for a protracted three or four years \\' voyage in some other ship than their own ; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman \\' s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a father \\' s natural but untimely partiality , or undue apprehensiveness and concern . meantime , now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of ahab ; and ahab still stood like an anvil , receiving every shock , but without the least quivering of his own . \" i will not go ,\" said the stranger , \" till you say aye to me . do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case . for you too have a boy , captain ahab -- though but a child , and nestling safely at home now -- a child of your old age too -- yes , yes , you relent ; i see it -- run , run , men , now , and stand by to square in the yards .\" \" avast ,\" cried ahab --\" touch not a rope - yarn \"; then in a voice that prolongingly moulded every word --\" captain gardiner , i will not do it . even now i lose time . good - bye , good - bye . god bless ye , man , and may i forgive myself , but i must go . mr . starbuck , look at the binnacle watch , and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers : then brace forward again , and let the ship sail as before .\" hurriedly turning , with averted face , he descended into his cabin , leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit . but starting from his enchantment , gardiner silently hurried to the side ; more fell than stepped into his boat , and returned to his ship . soon the two ships diverged their wakes ; and long as the strange vessel was in view , she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot , however small , on the sea . this way and that her yards were swung round ; starboard and larboard , she continued to tack ; now she beat against a head sea ; and again it pushed her before it ; while all the while , her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men , as three tall cherry trees , when the boys are cherrying among the boughs . but by her still halting course and winding , woeful way , you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray , still remained without comfort . she was rachel , weeping for her children , because they were not . chapter 129 the cabin . ( ahab moving to go on deck ; pip catches him by the hand to follow .) lad , lad , i tell thee thou must not follow ahab now . the hour is coming when ahab would not scare thee from him , yet would not have thee by him . there is that in thee , poor lad , which i feel too curing to my malady . like cures like ;

now , that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted ; now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered moby dick ;-- and now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters , whether sinning or sinned against ; now it was that there lurked a something in the old man \\' s eyes , which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see . as the unsetting polar star , which through the livelong , arctic , six months \\' night sustains its piercing , steady , central gaze ; so ahab \\' s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew . it domineered above them so , that all their bodings , doubts , misgivings , fears , were fain to hide beneath their souls , and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf . in this foreshadowing interval too , all humor , forced or natural , vanished . stubb no more strove to raise a smile ; starbuck no more strove to check one . alike , joy and sorrow , hope and fear , seemed ground to finest dust , and powdered , for the time , in the clamped mortar of ahab \\' s iron soul . like machines , they dumbly moved about the deck , ever conscious that the old man \\' s despot eye was on them . but did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours ; when he thought no glance but one was on him ; then you would have seen that even as ahab \\' s eyes so awed the crew \\' s , the inscrutable parsee \\' s glance awed his ; or somehow , at least , in some wild way , at times affected it . such an added , gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah now ; such ceaseless shudderings shook him ; that the men looked dubious at him ; half uncertain , as it seemed , whether indeed he were a mortal substance , or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being \\' s body . and that shadow was always hovering there . for not by night , even , had fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber , or go below . he would stand still for hours : but never sat or leaned ; his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say -- we two watchmen never rest . nor , at any time , by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck , unless ahab was before them ; either standing in his pivot - hole , or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits ,-- the main - mast and the mizen ; or else they saw him standing in the cabin - scuttle ,-- his living foot advanced upon the deck , as if to step ; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes ; so that however motionless he stood , however the days and nights were added on , that he had not swung in his hammock ; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat , they could never tell unerringly whether , for all this , his eyes were really closed at times ; or whether he was still intently scanning them ; no matter , though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch , and the unheeded night - damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone - carved coat and hat . the clothes that the night had wet , the next day \\' s sunshine dried upon him ; and so , day after day , and night after night ; he went no more beneath the planks ; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for . he ate in the same open air ; that is , his two only meals ,-- breakfast and dinner : supper he never touched ; nor reaped his beard ; which darkly grew all gnarled , as unearthed roots of trees blown over , which still grow idly on at naked base , though perished in the upper verdure . but though his whole life was now become one watch on deck ; and though the parsee \\' s mystic watch was without intermission as his own ; yet these two never seemed to speak -- one man to the other -- unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary . though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain ; openly , and to the awe - struck crew , they seemed pole - like asunder . if by day they chanced to speak one word ; by night , dumb men were both , so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange . at times , for longest hours , without a single hail , they stood far parted in the starlight ; ahab in his scuttle , the parsee by the mainmast ; but still fixedly gazing upon each other ; as if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow , in ahab the parsee his abandoned substance . and yet , somehow , did ahab -- in his own proper self , as daily , hourly , and every instant , commandingly revealed to his subordinates ,-- ahab seemed an independent lord ; the parsee but his slave . still again both seemed yoked together , and an unseen tyrant driving them ; the lean shade siding the solid rib . for be this parsee what he may , all rib and keel was solid ahab . at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn , his iron voice was heard from aft ,--\" man the mast - heads !\"-- and all through the day , till after sunset and after twilight , the same voice every hour , at the striking of the helmsman \\' s bell , was heard --\" what d \\' ye see ?-- sharp ! sharp !\" but when three or four days had slided by , after meeting the children - seeking rachel ; and no spout had yet been seen ; the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew \\' s fidelity ; at least , of nearly all except the pagan harpooneers ; he seemed to doubt , even , whether stubb and flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought . but if these suspicions were really his , he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them , however his actions might seem to hint them . \" i will have the first sight of the whale myself ,\"-- he said . \" aye ! ahab must have the doubloon ! and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines ; and sending a hand aloft , with a single sheaved block , to secure to the main - mast head , he received the two ends of the downward - reeved rope ; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end , in order to fasten it at the rail . this done , with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin , he looked round upon his crew , sweeping from one to the other ; pausing his glance long upon daggoo , queequeg , tashtego ; but shunning fedallah ; and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate , said ,--\" take the rope , sir -- i give it into thy hands , starbuck .\" then arranging his person in the basket , he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch , starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last ; and afterwards stood near it . and thus , with one hand clinging round the royal mast , ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles ,-- ahead , astern , this side , and that ,-- within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height . when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging , which chances to afford no foothold , the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot , and sustained there by the rope ; under these circumstances , its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it . because in such a wilderness of running rigging , whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck ; and when the deck - ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings , it would be but a natural fatality , if , unprovided with a constant watchman , the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea . so ahab \\' s proceedings in this matter were not unusual ; the only strange thing about them seemed to be , that starbuck , almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision -- one of those too , whose faithfulness on the look - out he had seemed to doubt somewhat ;-- it was strange , that this was the very man he should select for his watchman ; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person \\' s hands . now , the first time ahab was perched aloft ; ere he had been there ten minutes ; one of those red - billed savage sea - hawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast - heads of whalemen in these latitudes ; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings . then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air ; then spiralized downwards , and went eddying again round his head . but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon , ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird ; nor , indeed , would any one else have marked it much , it being no uncommon circumstance ; only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight . \" your hat , your hat , sir !\" suddenly cried the sicilian seaman , who being posted at the mizen - mast - head , stood directly behind ahab , though somewhat lower than his level , and with a deep gulf of air dividing them . but already the sable wing was before the old man \\' s eyes ; the long hooked bill at his head : with a scream , the black hawk darted away with his prize . an eagle flew thrice round tarquin \\' s head , removing his cap to replace it , and thereupon tanaquil , his wife , declared that tarquin would be king of rome . but only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good . ahab \\' s hat was never restored ; the wild hawk flew on and on with it ; far in advance of the prow : and at last disappeared ; while from the point of that disappearance , a minute black spot was dimly discerned , falling from that vast height into the sea . chapter 131 the pequod meets the delight . the intense pequod sailed on ; the rolling waves and days went by ; the life - buoy - coffin still lightly swung ; and another ship , most miserably misnamed the delight , was descried . as she drew nigh , all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams , called shears , which , in some whaling - ships , cross the quarter - deck at the height of eight or nine feet ; serving to carry the spare , unrigged , or disabled boats . upon the stranger \\' s shears were beheld the shattered , white ribs , and some few splintered planks , of what had once been a whale - boat ; but you now saw through this wreck , as plainly as you see through the peeled , half - unhinged , and bleaching skeleton of a horse . \" hast seen the white whale ?\" \" look !\" replied the hollow - cheeked captain from his taffrail ; and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck . \" hast killed him ?\" \" the harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that ,\" answered the other , sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck , whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together . \" not forged !\" and snatching perth \\' s levelled iron from the crotch , ahab held it out , exclaiming --\" look ye , nantucketer ; here in this hand i hold his death ! tempered in blood , and tempered by lightning are these barbs ; and i swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin , where the white whale most feels his accursed life !\" \" then god keep thee , old man -- see \\' st thou that \"-- pointing to the hammock --\" i bury but one of five stout men , who were alive only yesterday ; but were dead ere night . only that one i bury ; the rest were buried before they died ; you sail upon their tomb .\" then turning to his crew --\" are ye ready there ? place the plank then on the rail , and lift the body ; so , then -- oh ! god \"-- advancing towards the hammock with uplifted hands --\" may the resurrection and the life --\" \" brace forward ! up helm !\" cried ahab like lightning to his men . but the suddenly started pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea ; not so quick , indeed , but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism . as ahab now glided from the dejected delight , the strange life - buoy hanging at the pequod \\' s stern came into conspicuous relief . \" ha ! yonder ! look yonder , men !\" cried a foreboding voice in her wake . \" in vain , oh , ye strangers , ye fly our sad burial ; ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin !\" chapter 132 the symphony . it was a clear steel - blue day . the firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that all - pervading azure ; only , the pensive air was transparently pure and soft , with a woman \\' s look , and the robust and man - like sea heaved with long , strong , lingering swells , as samson \\' s chest in his sleep . hither , and thither , on high , glided the snow - white wings of small , unspeckled birds ; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air ; but to and fro in the deeps , far down in the bottomless blue , rushed mighty leviathans , sword - fish , and sharks ; and these were the strong , troubled , murderous thinkings of the masculine sea . but though thus contrasting within , the contrast was only in shades and shadows without ; those two seemed one ; it was only the sex , as it were , that distinguished them . aloft , like a royal czar and king , the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea ; even as bride to groom . and at the girdling line of the horizon , a soft and tremulous motion -- most seen here at the equator -- denoted the fond , throbbing trust , the loving alarms , with which the poor bride gave her bosom away . tied up and twisted ; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles ; haggardly firm and unyielding ; his eyes glowing like coals , that still glow in the ashes of ruin ; untottering ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn ; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl \\' s forehead of heaven . oh , immortal infancy , and innocency of the azure ! invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us ! sweet childhood of air and sky ! how oblivious were ye of old ahab \\' s close - coiled woe ! but so have i seen little miriam and martha , laughing - eyed elves , heedlessly gambol around their old sire ; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt - out crater of his brain . slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle , ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze , the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity . but the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel , for a moment , the cankerous thing in his soul . that glad , happy air , that winsome sky , did at last stroke and caress him ; the step - mother world , so long cruel -- forbidding -- now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck , and did seem to joyously sob over him , as if over one , that however wilful and erring , she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless . from beneath his slouched hat ahab dropped a tear into the sea ; nor did all the pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop . starbuck saw the old man ; saw him , how he heavily leaned over the side ; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around . careful not to touch him , or be noticed by him , he yet drew near to him , and stood there . ahab turned . \" starbuck !\" \" sir .\" \" oh , starbuck ! it is a mild , mild wind , and a mild looking sky . on such a day -- very much such a sweetness as this -- i struck my first whale -- a boy - harpooneer of eighteen ! forty -- forty -- forty years ago !-- ago ! forty years of continual whaling ! forty years of privation , and peril , and storm - time ! forty years on the pitiless sea ! for forty years has ahab forsaken the peaceful land , for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep ! aye and yes , starbuck , out of those forty years i have not spent three ashore . when i think of this life i have led ; the desolation of solitude it has been ; the masoned , walled - town of a captain \\' s exclusiveness , which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without -- oh , weariness ! heaviness ! guinea - coast slavery of solitary command !-- when i think of all this ; only half - suspected , not so keenly known to me before -- and how for forty years i have fed upon dry salted fare -- fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil !-- when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand , and broken the world \\' s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts -- away , whole oceans away , from that young girl - wife i wedded past fifty , and sailed for cape horn the next day , leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow -- wife ? wife ?-- rather a widow with her husband alive ! aye , i widowed that poor girl when i married her , starbuck ; and then , the madness , the frenzy , the boiling blood and the smoking brow , with which , for a thousand lowerings old ahab has furiously , foamingly chased his prey -- more a demon than a man !-- aye , aye ! what a forty years \\' fool -- fool -- old fool , has old ahab been ! why this strife of the chase ? why weary , and palsy the arm at the oar , and the iron , and the lance ? how the richer or better is ahab now ? behold . oh , starbuck ! is it not hard , that with this weary load i bear , one poor leg should have been snatched from under me ? here , brush this old hair aside ; it blinds me , that i seem to weep . locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes ! but do i look very old , so very , very old , starbuck ? i feel deadly faint , bowed , and humped , as though i were adam , staggering beneath the piled centuries since paradise . god ! god ! god !-- crack my heart !-- stave my brain !-- mockery ! mockery ! bitter , biting mockery of grey hairs , have i lived enough joy to wear ye ; and seem and feel thus intolerably old ? close ! stand close to me , starbuck ; let me look into a human eye ; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky ; better than to gaze upon god . by the green land ; by the bright hearth - stone ! this is the magic glass , man ; i see my wife and my child in thine eye . no , no ; stay on board , on board !-- lower not when i do ; when branded ahab gives chase to moby dick . that hazard shall not be thine . no , no ! not with the far away home i see in that eye !\" \" oh , my captain ! my captain ! noble soul ! grand old heart , after all ! why should any one give chase to that hated fish ! away with me ! let us fly these deadly waters ! let us home ! wife and child , too , are starbuck \\' s -- wife and child of his brotherly , sisterly , play - fellow youth ; even as thine , sir , are the wife and child of thy loving , longing , paternal old age ! away ! let us away !-- this instant let me alter the course ! how cheerily , how hilariously , o my captain , would we bowl on our way to see old nantucket again ! i think , sir , they have some such mild blue days , even as this , in nantucket .\" \" they have , they have . i have seen them -- some summer days in the morning . about this time -- yes , it is his noon nap now -- the boy vivaciously wakes ; sits up in bed ; and his mother tells him of me , of cannibal old me ; how i am abroad upon the deep , but will yet come back to dance him again .\" \"\\' tis my mary , my mary herself ! she promised that my boy , every morning , should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father \\' s sail ! yes , yes ! no more ! it is done ! we head for nantucket ! come , my captain , study out the course , and let us away ! see , see ! the boy \\' s face from the window ! the boy \\' s hand on the hill !\" but ahab \\' s glance was averted ; like a blighted fruit tree he shook , and cast his last , cindered apple to the soil . \" what is it , what nameless , inscrutable , unearthly thing is it ; what cozening , hidden lord and master , and cruel , remorseless emperor commands me ; that against all natural lovings and longings , i so keep pushing , and crowding , and jamming myself on all the time ; recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper , natural heart , i durst not so much as dare ? is ahab , ahab ? is it i , god , or who , that lifts this arm ? but if the great sun move not of himself ; but is as an errand - boy in heaven ; nor one single star can revolve , but by some invisible power ; how then can this one small heart beat ; this one small brain think thoughts ; unless god does that beating , does that thinking , does that living , and not i . by heaven , man , we are turned round and round in this world , like yonder windlass , and fate is the handspike . and all the time , lo ! that smiling sky , and this unsounded sea ! look ! see yon albicore ! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying - fish ? where do murderers go , man ! who \\' s to doom , when the judge himself is dragged to the bar ? but it is a mild , mild wind , and a mild looking sky ; and the air smells now , as if it blew from a far - away meadow ; they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the andes , starbuck , and the mowers are sleeping among the new - mown hay . sleeping ? aye , toil we how we may , we all sleep at last on the field . sleep ? aye , and rust amid greenness ; as last year \\' s scythes flung down , and left in the half - cut swaths -- starbuck !\" but blanched to a corpse \\' s hue with despair , the mate had stolen away . ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side ; but started at two reflected , fixed eyes in the water there . fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail . chapter 133 the chase -- first day . that night , in the mid - watch , when the old man -- as his wont at intervals -- stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned , and went to his pivot - hole , he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely , snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship \\' s dog will , in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle . he declared that a whale must be near . soon that peculiar odor , sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale , was palpable to all the watch ; nor was any mariner surprised when , after inspecting the compass , and then the dog - vane , and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible , ahab rapidly ordered the ship \\' s course to be slightly altered , and the sail to be shortened . the acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak , by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead , smooth as oil , and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it , the polished metallic - like marks of some swift tide - rip , at the mouth of a deep , rapid stream . \" man the mast - heads ! call all hands !\" thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck , daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle , so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands . \" what d \\' ye see ?\" cried ahab , flattening his face to the sky . \" nothing , nothing sir !\" was the sound hailing down in reply . \" t \\' gallant sails !-- stunsails ! alow and aloft , and on both sides !\" all sail being set , he now cast loose the life - line , reserved for swaying him to the main royal - mast head ; and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither , when , while but two thirds of the way aloft , and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main - top - sail and top - gallant - sail , he raised a gull - like cry in the air . \" there she blows !-- there she blows ! a hump like a snow - hill ! it is moby dick !\" fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look - outs , the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing . ahab had now gained his final perch , some feet above the other look - outs , tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the top - gallant - mast , so that the indian \\' s head was almost on a level with ahab \\' s heel . from this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead , at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump , and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air . to the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit atlantic and indian oceans . \" and did none of ye see it before ?\" cried ahab , hailing the perched men all around him . \" i saw him almost that same instant , sir , that captain ahab did , and i cried out ,\" said tashtego . \" not the same instant ; not the same -- no , the doubloon is mine , fate reserved the doubloon for me . i only ; none of ye could have raised the white whale first . there she blows !-- there she blows !-- there she blows ! there again !-- there again !\" he cried , in long - drawn , lingering , methodic tones , attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale \\' s visible jets . \" he \\' s going to sound ! in stunsails ! down top - gallant - sails ! stand by three boats . mr . starbuck , remember , stay on board , and keep the ship . helm there ! luff , luff a point ! so ; steady , man , steady ! there go flukes ! no , no ; only black water ! all ready the boats there ? stand by , stand by ! lower me , mr . starbuck ; lower , lower ,-- quick , quicker !\" and he slid through the air to the deck . \" he is heading straight to leeward , sir ,\" cried stubb , \" right away from us ; cannot have seen the ship yet .\" \" be dumb , man ! stand by the braces ! hard down the helm !-- brace up ! shiver her !-- shiver her !-- so ; well that ! boats , boats !\" soon all the boats but starbuck \\' s were dropped ; all the boat - sails set -- all the paddles plying ; with rippling swiftness , shooting to leeward ; and ahab heading the onset . a pale , death - glimmer lit up fedallah \\' s sunken eyes ; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth . like noiseless nautilus shells , their light prows sped through the sea ; but only slowly they neared the foe . as they neared him , the ocean grew still more smooth ; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves ; seemed a noon - meadow , so serenely it spread . at length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey , that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible , sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing , and continually set in a revolving ring of finest , fleecy , greenish foam . he saw the vast , involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond . before it , far out on the soft turkish - rugged waters , went the glistening white shadow from his broad , milky forehead , a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade ; and behind , the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake ; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side . but these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea , alternate with their fitful flight ; and like to some flag - staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy , the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale \\' s back ; and at intervals one of the cloud of soft - toed fowls hovering , and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish , silently perched and rocked on this pole , the long tail feathers streaming like pennons . a gentle joyousness -- a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness , invested the gliding whale . not the white bull jupiter swimming away with ravished europa clinging to his graceful horns ; his lovely , leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid ; with smooth bewitching fleetness , rippling straight for the nuptial bower in crete ; not jove , not that great majesty supreme ! did surpass the glorified white whale as he so divinely swam . on each soft side -- coincident with the parted swell , that but once leaving him , then flowed so wide away -- on each bright side , the whale shed off enticings . no wonder there had been some among the hunters who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity , had ventured to assail it ; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes . yet calm , enticing calm , oh , whale ! thou glidest on , to all who for the first time eye thee , no matter how many in that same way thou may \\' st have bejuggled and destroyed before . and thus , through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea , among waves whose hand - clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture , moby dick moved on , still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk , entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw . but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water ; for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch , like virginia \\' s natural bridge , and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air , the grand god revealed himself , sounded , and went out of sight . hoveringly halting , and dipping on the wing , the white sea - fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left . with oars apeak , and paddles down , the sheets of their sails adrift , the three boats now stilly floated , awaiting moby dick \\' s reappearance . \" an hour ,\" said ahab , standing rooted in his boat \\' s stern ; and he gazed beyond the whale \\' s place , towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward . it was only an instant ; for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle . the breeze now freshened ; the sea began to swell . \" the birds !-- the birds !\" cried tashtego . in long indian file , as when herons take wing , the white birds were now all flying towards ahab \\' s boat ; and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there , wheeling round and round , with joyous , expectant cries . their vision was keener than man \\' s ; ahab could discover no sign in the sea . but suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths , he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel , with wonderful celerity uprising , and magnifying as it rose , till it turned , and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white , glistening teeth , floating up from the undiscoverable bottom . it was moby dick \\' s open mouth and scrolled jaw ; his vast , shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea . the glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open - doored marble tomb ; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar , ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition . then , calling upon fedallah to change places with him , went forward to the bows , and seizing perth \\' s harpoon , commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern . now , by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis , its bow , by anticipation , was made to face the whale \\' s head while yet under water . but as if perceiving this stratagem , moby dick , with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him , sidelingly transplanted himself , as it were , in an instant , shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat . through and through ; through every plank and each rib , it thrilled for an instant , the whale obliquely lying on his back , in the manner of a biting shark , slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth , so that the long , narrow , scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air , and one of the teeth caught in a row - lock . the bluish pearl - white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahab \\' s head , and reached higher than that . in this attitude the white whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse . with unastonished eyes fedallah gazed , and crossed his arms ; but the tiger - yellow crew were tumbling over each other \\' s heads to gain the uttermost stern . and now , while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out , as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way ; and from his body being submerged beneath the boat , he could not be darted at from the bows , for the bows were almost inside of him , as it were ; and while the other boats involuntarily paused , as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand , then it was that monomaniac ahab , furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe , which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated ; frenzied with all this , he seized the long bone with his naked hands , and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe . as now he thus vainly strove , the jaw slipped from him ; the frail gunwales bent in , collapsed , and snapped , as both jaws , like an enormous shears , sliding further aft , bit the craft completely in twain , and locked themselves fast again in the sea , midway between the two floating wrecks . these floated aside , the broken ends drooping , the crew at the stern - wreck clinging to the gunwales , and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across . at that preluding moment , ere the boat was yet snapped , ahab , the first to perceive the whale \\' s intent , by the crafty upraising of his head , a movement that loosed his hold for the time ; at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite . but only slipping further into the whale \\' s mouth , and tilting over sideways as it slipped , the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw ; spilled him out of it , as he leaned to the push ; and so he fell flat - faced upon the sea . ripplingly withdrawing from his prey , moby dick now lay at a little distance , vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows ; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body ; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose -- some twenty or more feet out of the water -- the now rising swells , with all their confluent waves , dazzlingly broke against it ; vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air .* so , in a gale , the but half baffled channel billows only recoil from the base of the eddystone , triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud . * this motion is peculiar to the sperm whale . it receives its designation ( pitchpoling ) from its being likened to that preliminary up - and - down poise of the whale - lance , in the exercise called pitchpoling , previously described . by this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him . but soon resuming his horizontal attitude , moby dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew ; sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake , as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault . the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him , as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before antiochus \\' s elephants in the book of maccabees . meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale \\' s insolent tail , and too much of a cripple to swim ,-- though he could still keep afloat , even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that ; helpless ahab \\' s head was seen , like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst . from the boat \\' s fragmentary stern , fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him ; the clinging crew , at the other drifting end , could not succor him ; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves . for so revolvingly appalling was the white whale \\' s aspect , and so planetarily swift the ever - contracting circles he made , that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them . and though the other boats , unharmed , still hovered hard by ; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike , lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways , ahab and all ; nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape . with straining eyes , then , they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone , whose centre had now become the old man \\' s head . meantime , from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship \\' s mast heads ; and squaring her yards , she had borne down upon the scene ; and was now so nigh , that ahab in the water hailed her !--\" sail on the \"-- but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from moby dick , and whelmed him for the time . but struggling out of it again , and chancing to rise on a towering crest , he shouted ,--\" sail on the whale !-- drive him off !\" the pequod \\' s prows were pointed ; and breaking up the charmed circle , she effectually parted the white whale from his victim . as he sullenly swam off , the boats flew to the rescue . dragged into stubb \\' s boat with blood - shot , blinded eyes , the white brine caking in his wrinkles ; the long tension of ahab \\' s bodily strength did crack , and helplessly he yielded to his body \\' s doom : for a time , lying all crushed in the bottom of stubb \\' s boat , like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants . far inland , nameless wails came from him , as desolate sounds from out ravines . but this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more abbreviate it . in an instant \\' s compass , great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang , the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler men \\' s whole lives . and so , such hearts , though summary in each one suffering ; still , if the gods decree it , in their life - time aggregate a whole age of woe , wholly made up of instantaneous intensities ; for even in their pointless centres , those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls . \" the harpoon ,\" said ahab , half way rising , and draggingly leaning on one bended arm --\" is it safe ?\" \" aye , sir , for it was not darted ; this is it ,\" said stubb , showing it . \" lay it before me ;-- any missing men ?\" \" one , two , three , four , five ;-- there were five oars , sir , and here are five men .\" \" that \\' s good .-- help me , man ; i wish to stand . so , so , i see him ! there ! there ! going to leeward still ; what a leaping spout !-- hands off from me ! the eternal sap runs up in ahab \\' s bones again ! set the sail ; out oars ; the helm !\" it is often the case that when a boat is stove , its crew , being picked up by another boat , help to work that second boat ; and the chase is thus continued with what is called double - banked oars . it was thus now . but the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale , for he seemed to have treble - banked his every fin ; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed , that if now , under these circumstances , pushed on , the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged , if not a hopeless one ; nor could any crew endure for so long a period , such an unintermitted , intense straining at the oar ; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude . the ship itself , then , as it sometimes happens , offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase . accordingly , the boats now made for her , and were soon swayed up to their cranes -- the two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her -- and then hoisting everything to her side , and stacking her canvas high up , and sideways outstretching it with stun - sails , like the double - jointed wings of an albatross ; the pequod bore down in the leeward wake of moby - dick . at the well known , methodic intervals , the whale \\' s glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mast - heads ; and when he would be reported as just gone down , ahab would take the time , and then pacing the deck , binnacle - watch in hand , so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired , his voice was heard .--\" whose is the doubloon now ? d \\' ye see him ?\" and if the reply was , no , sir ! straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch . in this way the day wore on ; ahab , now aloft and motionless ; anon , unrestingly pacing the planks . as he was thus walking , uttering no sound , except to hail the men aloft , or to bid them hoist a sail still higher , or to spread one to a still greater breadth -- thus to and fro pacing , beneath his slouched hat , at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat , which had been dropped upon the quarter - deck , and lay there reversed ; broken bow to shattered stern . at last he paused before it ; and as in an already over - clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across , so over the old man \\' s face there now stole some such added gloom as this . stubb saw him pause ; and perhaps intending , not vainly , though , to evince his own unabated fortitude , and thus keep up a valiant place in his captain \\' s mind , he advanced , and eyeing the wreck exclaimed --\" the thistle the ass refused ; it pricked his mouth too keenly , sir ; ha ! ha !\" \" what soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck ? man , man ! did i not know thee brave as fearless fire ( and as mechanical ) i could swear thou wert a poltroon . groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck .\" \" aye , sir ,\" said starbuck drawing near , \"\\' tis a solemn sight ; an omen , and an ill one .\" \" omen ? omen ?-- the dictionary ! if the gods think to speak outright to man , they will honourably speak outright ; not shake their heads , and give an old wives \\' darkling hint .-- begone ! ye two are the opposite poles of one thing ; starbuck is stubb reversed , and stubb is starbuck ; and ye two are all mankind ; and ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth , nor gods nor men his neighbors ! cold , cold -- i shiver !-- how now ? aloft there ! d \\' ye see him ? sing out for every spout , though he spout ten times a second !\" the day was nearly done ; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling . soon , it was almost dark , but the look - out men still remained unset . \" can \\' t see the spout now , sir ;-- too dark \"-- cried a voice from the air . \" how heading when last seen ?\" \" as before , sir ,-- straight to leeward .\" \" good ! he will travel slower now \\' tis night . down royals and top - gallant stun - sails , mr . starbuck . we must not run over him before morning ; he \\' s making a passage now , and may heave - to a while . helm there ! keep her full before the wind !-- aloft ! come down !-- mr . stubb , send a fresh hand to the fore - mast head , and see it manned till morning .\"-- then advancing towards the doubloon in the main - mast --\" men , this gold is mine , for i earned it ; but i shall let it abide here till the white whale is dead ; and then , whosoever of ye first raises him , upon the day he shall be killed , this gold is that man \\' s ; and if on that day i shall again raise him , then , ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye ! away now !-- the deck is thine , sir !\" and so saying , he placed himself half way within the scuttle , and slouching his hat , stood there till dawn , except when at intervals rousing himself to see how the night wore on . chapter 134 the chase -- second day . at day - break , the three mast - heads were punctually manned afresh . \" d \\' ye see him ?\" cried ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread . \" see nothing , sir .\" \" turn up all hands and make sail ! he travels faster than i thought for ;-- the top - gallant sails !-- aye , they should have been kept on her all night . but no matter --\\' tis but resting for the rush .\" here be it said , that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale , continued through day into night , and through night into day , is a thing by no means unprecedented in the south sea fishery . for such is the wonderful skill , prescience of experience , and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the nantucket commanders ; that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried , they will , under certain given circumstances , pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time , while out of sight , as well as his probable rate of progression during that period . and , in these cases , somewhat as a pilot , when about losing sight of a coast , whose general trending he well knows , and which he desires shortly to return to again , but at some further point ; like as this pilot stands by his compass , and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible , in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote , unseen headland , eventually to be visited : so does the fisherman , at his compass , with the whale ; for after being chased , and diligently marked , through several hours of daylight , then , when night obscures the fish , the creature \\' s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter , as the pilot \\' s coast is to him . so that to this hunter \\' s wondrous skill , the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water , a wake , is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land . and as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace , that , with watches in their hands , men time his rate as doctors that of a baby \\' s pulse ; and lightly say of it , the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot , at such or such an hour ; even so , almost , there are occasions when these nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deep , according to the observed humor of his speed ; and say to themselves , so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles , will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude . but to render this acuteness at all successful in the end , the wind and the sea must be the whaleman \\' s allies ; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety - three leagues and a quarter from his port ? inferable from these statements , are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales . the ship tore on ; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon - ball , missent , becomes a plough - share and turns up the level field . \" by salt and hemp !\" cried stubb , \" but this swift motion of the deck creeps up one \\' s legs and tingles at the heart . this ship and i are two brave fellows !-- ha , ha ! some one take me up , and launch me , spine - wise , on the sea ,-- for by live - oaks ! my spine \\' s a keel . ha , ha ! we go the gait that leaves no dust behind !\" \" there she blows -- she blows !-- she blows !-- right ahead !\" was now the mast - head cry . \" aye , aye !\" cried stubb , \" i knew it -- ye can \\' t escape -- blow on and split your spout , o whale ! the mad fiend himself is after ye ! blow your trump -- blister your lungs !-- ahab will dam off your blood , as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream !\" and stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew . the frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up , like old wine worked anew . whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before ; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of ahab , but they were broken up , and on all sides routed , as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison . the hand of fate had snatched all their souls ; and by the stirring perils of the previous day ; the rack of the past night \\' s suspense ; the fixed , unfearing , blind , reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark ; by all these things , their hearts were bowled along . the wind that made great bellies of their sails , and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible ; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race . they were one man , not thirty . for as the one ship that held them all ; though it was put together of all contrasting things -- oak , and maple , and pine wood ; iron , and pitch , and hemp -- yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull , which shot on its way , both balanced and directed by the long central keel ; even so , all the individualities of the crew , this man \\' s valor , that man \\' s fear ; guilt and guiltiness , all varieties were welded into oneness , and were all directed to that fatal goal which ahab their one lord and keel did point to . the rigging lived . the mast - heads , like the tops of tall palms , were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs . clinging to a spar with one hand , some reached forth the other with impatient wavings ; others , shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight , sat far out on the rocking yards ; all the spars in full bearing of mortals , ready and ripe for their fate . ah ! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them ! \" why sing ye not out for him , if ye see him ?\" cried ahab , when , after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry , no more had been heard . \" sway me up , men ; ye have been deceived ; not moby dick casts one odd jet that way , and then disappears .\" it was even so ; in their headlong eagerness , the men had mistaken some other thing for the whale - spout , as the event itself soon proved ; for hardly had ahab reached his perch ; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck , when he struck the key - note to an orchestra , that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles . the triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard , as -- much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet , less than a mile ahead -- moby dick bodily burst into view ! for not by any calm and indolent spoutings ; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head , did the white whale now reveal his vicinity ; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching . rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths , the sperm whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air , and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam , shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more . in those moments , the torn , enraged waves he shakes off , seem his mane ; in some cases , this breaching is his act of defiance . \" there she breaches ! there she breaches !\" was the cry , as in his immeasurable bravadoes the white whale tossed himself salmon - like to heaven . so suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea , and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky , the spray that he raised , for the moment , intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier ; and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity , to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale . \" aye , breach your last to the sun , moby dick !\" cried ahab , \" thy hour and thy harpoon are at hand !-- down ! down all of ye , but one man at the fore . the boats !-- stand by !\" unmindful of the tedious rope - ladders of the shrouds , the men , like shooting stars , slid to the deck , by the isolated backstays and halyards ; while ahab , less dartingly , but still rapidly was dropped from his perch . \" lower away ,\" he cried , so soon as he had reached his boat -- a spare one , rigged the afternoon previous . \" mr . starbuck , the ship is thine -- keep away from the boats , but keep near them . lower , all !\" as if to strike a quick terror into them , by this time being the first assailant himself , moby dick had turned , and was now coming for the three crews . ahab \\' s boat was central ; and cheering his men , he told them he would take the whale head - and - head ,-- that is , pull straight up to his forehead ,-- a not uncommon thing ; for when within a certain limit , such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale \\' s sidelong vision . but ere that close limit was gained , and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship \\' s three masts to his eye ; the white whale churning himself into furious speed , almost in an instant as it were , rushing among the boats with open jaws , and a lashing tail , offered appalling battle on every side ; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat , seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made . but skilfully manoeuvred , incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field ; the boats for a while eluded him ; though , at times , but by a plank \\' s breadth ; while all the time , ahab \\' s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds . but at last in his untraceable evolutions , the white whale so crossed and recrossed , and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him , that they foreshortened , and , of themselves , warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him ; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little , as if to rally for a more tremendous charge . seizing that opportunity , ahab first paid out more line : and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again -- hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls -- when lo !-- a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks ! caught and twisted -- corkscrewed in the mazes of the line , loose harpoons and lances , with all their bristling barbs and points , came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of ahab \\' s boat . only one thing could be done . seizing the boat - knife , he critically reached within -- through -- and then , without -- the rays of steel ; dragged in the line beyond , passed it , inboard , to the bowsman , and then , twice sundering the rope near the chocks -- dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea ; and was all fast again . that instant , the white whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines ; by so doing , irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of stubb and flask towards his flukes ; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf - beaten beach , and then , diving down into the sea , disappeared in a boiling maelstrom , in which , for a space , the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round , like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch . while the two crews were yet circling in the waters , reaching out after the revolving line - tubs , oars , and other floating furniture , while aslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial , twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks ; and stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up ; and while the old man \\' s line -- now parting -- admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could ;-- in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils ,-- ahab \\' s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards heaven by invisible wires ,-- as , arrow - like , shooting perpendicularly from the sea , the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom , and sent it , turning over and over , into the air ; till it fell again -- gunwale downwards -- and ahab and his men struggled out from under it , like seals from a sea - side cave . the first uprising momentum of the whale -- modifying its direction as he struck the surface -- involuntarily launched him along it , to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made ; and with his back to it , he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side ; and whenever a stray oar , bit of plank , the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin , his tail swiftly drew back , and came sideways smiting the sea . but soon , as if satisfied that his work for that time was done , he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean , and trailing after him the intertangled lines , continued his leeward way at a traveller \\' s methodic pace . as before , the attentive ship having descried the whole fight , again came bearing down to the rescue , and dropping a boat , picked up the floating mariners , tubs , oars , and whatever else could be caught at , and safely landed them on her decks . some sprained shoulders , wrists , and ankles ; livid contusions ; wrenched harpoons and lances ; inextricable intricacies of rope ; shattered oars and planks ; all these were there ; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one . as with fedallah the day before , so ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat \\' s broken half , which afforded a comparatively easy float ; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day \\' s mishap . but when he was helped to the deck , all eyes were fastened upon him ; as instead of standing by himself he still half - hung upon the shoulder of starbuck , who had thus far been the foremost to assist him . his ivory leg had been snapped off , leaving but one short sharp splinter . \" aye , aye , starbuck , \\' tis sweet to lean sometimes , be the leaner who he will ; and would old ahab had leaned oftener than he has .\" \" the ferrule has not stood , sir ,\" said the carpenter , now coming up ; \" i put good work into that leg .\" \" but no bones broken , sir , i hope ,\" said stubb with true concern . \" aye ! and all splintered to pieces , stubb !-- d \\' ye see it .-- but even with a broken bone , old ahab is untouched ; and i account no living bone of mine one jot more me , than this dead one that \\' s lost . nor white whale , nor man , nor fiend , can so much as graze old ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being . can any lead touch yonder floor , any mast scrape yonder roof ?-- aloft there ! which way ?\" \" dead to leeward , sir .\" \" up helm , then ; pile on the sail again , ship keepers ! down the rest of the spare boats and rig them -- mr . starbuck away , and muster the boat \\' s crews .\" \" let me first help thee towards the bulwarks , sir .\" \" oh , oh , oh ! how this splinter gores me now ! accursed fate ! that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate !\" \" sir ?\" \" my body , man , not thee . give me something for a cane -- there , that shivered lance will do . muster the men . surely i have not seen him yet . by heaven it cannot be !-- missing ?-- quick ! call them all .\" the old man \\' s hinted thought was true . upon mustering the company , the parsee was not there . \" the parsee !\" cried stubb --\" he must have been caught in --\" \" the black vomit wrench thee !-- run all of ye above , alow , cabin , forecastle -- find him -- not gone -- not gone !\" but quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the parsee was nowhere to be found . \" aye , sir ,\" said stubb --\" caught among the tangles of your line -- i thought i saw him dragging under .\" \" my line ! my line ? gone ?-- gone ? what means that little word ?-- what death - knell rings in it , that old ahab shakes as if he were the belfry . the harpoon , too !-- toss over the litter there ,-- d \\' ye see it ?-- the forged iron , men , the white whale \\' s -- no , no , no ,-- blistered fool ! this hand did dart it !--\\' tis in the fish !-- aloft there ! keep him nailed -- quick !-- all hands to the rigging of the boats -- collect the oars -- harpooneers ! the irons , the irons !-- hoist the royals higher -- a pull on all the sheets !-- helm there ! steady , steady for your life ! i \\' ll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe ;

twice stove to splinters ; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee ; thy evil shadow gone -- all good angels mobbing thee with warnings :-- what more wouldst thou have ?-- shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man ? shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea ? shall we be towed by him to the infernal world ? oh , oh ,-- impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more !\" \" starbuck , of late i \\' ve felt strangely moved to thee ;

only , the sound of hammers , and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight , as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow . meantime , of the broken keel of ahab \\' s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg ; while still as on the night before , slouched ahab stood fixed within his scuttle ; his hid , heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial ; sat due eastward for the earliest sun . chapter 135 the chase .-- third day . the morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh , and once more the solitary night - man at the fore - mast - head was relieved by crowds of the daylight look - outs , who dotted every mast and almost every spar . \" d \\' ye see him ?\" cried ahab ; but the whale was not yet in sight . \" in his infallible wake , though ; but follow that wake , that \\' s all . helm there ; steady , as thou goest , and hast been going . what a lovely day again ! were it a new - made world , and made for a summer - house to the angels , and this morning the first of its throwing open to them , a fairer day could not dawn upon that world . here \\' s food for thought , had ahab time to think ; but ahab never thinks ; he only feels , feels , feels ; that \\' s tingling enough for mortal man ! to think \\' s audacity . god only has that right and privilege . thinking is , or ought to be , a coolness and a calmness ; and our poor hearts throb , and our poor brains beat too much for that . and yet , i \\' ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm -- frozen calm , this old skull cracks so , like a glass in which the contents turned to ice , and shiver it . and still this hair is growing now ; this moment growing , and heat must breed it ; but no , it \\' s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere , between the earthy clefts of greenland ice or in vesuvius lava . how the wild winds blow it ; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to . a vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells , and wards of hospitals , and ventilated them , and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces . out upon it !-- it \\' s tainted . were i the wind , i \\' d blow no more on such a wicked , miserable world . i \\' d crawl somewhere to a cave , and slink there . and yet , \\' tis a noble and heroic thing , the wind ! who ever conquered it ? in every fight it has the last and bitterest blow . run tilting at it , and you but run through it . ha ! a coward wind that strikes stark naked men , but will not stand to receive a single blow . even ahab is a braver thing -- a nobler thing than that . would now the wind but had a body ;

and veer not from their mark , however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack , and mightiest mississippies of the land swift and swerve about , uncertain where to go at last . and by the eternal poles ! these same trades that so directly blow my good ship on ;

not i , him -- that \\' s bad ; i might have known it , too . fool ! the lines -- the harpoons he \\' s towing . aye , aye , i have run him by last night . about ! about ! come down , all of ye , but the regular look outs ! man the braces !\" steering as she had done , the wind had been somewhat on the pequod \\' s quarter , so that now being pointed in the reverse direction , the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake . \" against the wind he now steers for the open jaw ,\" murmured starbuck to himself , as he coiled the new - hauled main - brace upon the rail . \" god keep us , but already my bones feel damp within me , and from the inside wet my flesh . i misdoubt me that i disobey my god in obeying him !\" \" stand by to sway me up !\" cried ahab , advancing to the hempen basket . \" we should meet him soon .\" \" aye , aye , sir ,\" and straightway starbuck did ahab \\' s bidding , and once more ahab swung on high . a whole hour now passed ; gold - beaten out to ages . time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense . but at last , some three points off the weather bow , ahab descried the spout again , and instantly from the three mast - heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it . \" forehead to forehead i meet thee , this third time , moby dick ! on deck there !-- brace sharper up ; crowd her into the wind \\' s eye . he \\' s too far off to lower yet , mr . starbuck . the sails shake ! stand over that helmsman with a top - maul ! so , so ; he travels fast , and i must down . but let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea ; there \\' s time for that . an old , old sight , and yet somehow so young ; aye , and not changed a wink since i first saw it , a boy , from the sand - hills of nantucket ! the same !-- the same !-- the same to noah as to me . there \\' s a soft shower to leeward . such lovely leewardings ! they must lead somewhere -- to something else than common land , more palmy than the palms . leeward ! the white whale goes that way ; look to windward , then ; the better if the bitterer quarter . but good bye , good bye , old mast - head ! what \\' s this ?-- green ? aye , tiny mosses in these warped cracks . no such green weather stains on ahab \\' s head ! there \\' s the difference now between man \\' s old age and matter \\' s . but aye , old mast , we both grow old together ; sound in our hulls , though , are we not , my ship ? aye , minus a leg , that \\' s all . by heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way . i can \\' t compare with it ; and i \\' ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers . what \\' s that he said ? he should still go before me , my pilot ; and yet to be seen again ? but where ? will i have eyes at the bottom of the sea , supposing i descend those endless stairs ? and all night i \\' ve been sailing from him , wherever he did sink to . aye , aye , like many more thou told \\' st direful truth as touching thyself , o parsee ; but , ahab , there thy shot fell short . good - bye , mast - head -- keep a good eye upon the whale , the while i \\' m gone . we \\' ll talk to - morrow , nay , to - night , when the white whale lies down there , tied by head and tail .\" he gave the word ; and still gazing round him , was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck . in due time the boats were lowered ; but as standing in his shallop \\' s stern , ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent , he waved to the mate ,-- who held one of the tackle - ropes on deck -- and bade him pause . \" starbuck !\" \" sir ?\" \" for the third time my soul \\' s ship starts upon this voyage , starbuck .\" \" aye , sir , thou wilt have it so .\" \" some ships sail from their ports , and ever afterwards are missing , starbuck !\" \" truth , sir : saddest truth .\" \" some men die at ebb tide ; some at low water ; some at the full of the flood ;-- and i feel now like a billow that \\' s all one crested comb , starbuck . i am old ;-- shake hands with me , man .\" their hands met ; their eyes fastened ; starbuck \\' s tears the glue . \" oh , my captain , my captain !-- noble heart -- go not -- go not !-- see , it \\' s a brave man that weeps ; how great the agony of the persuasion then !\" \" lower away !\"-- cried ahab , tossing the mate \\' s arm from him . \" stand by the crew !\" in an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern . \" the sharks ! the sharks !\" cried a voice from the low cabin - window there ; \" o master , my master , come back !\" but ahab heard nothing ; for his own voice was high - lifted then ; and the boat leaped on . yet the voice spake true ; for scarce had he pushed from the ship , when numbers of sharks , seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull , maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars , every time they dipped in the water ; and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites . it is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale - boats in those swarming seas ; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east . but these were the first sharks that had been observed by the pequod since the white whale had been first descried ; and whether it was that ahab \\' s crew were all such tiger - yellow barbarians , and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks -- a matter sometimes well known to affect them ,-- however it was , they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others . \" heart of wrought steel !\" murmured starbuck gazing over the side , and following with his eyes the receding boat --\" canst thou yet ring boldly to that sight ?-- lowering thy keel among ravening sharks , and followed by them , open - mouthed to the chase ; and this the critical third day ?-- for when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit ; be sure the first is the morning , the second the noon , and the third the evening and the end of that thing -- be that end what it may . oh ! my god ! what is this that shoots through me , and leaves me so deadly calm , yet expectant ,-- fixed at the top of a shudder ! future things swim before me , as in empty outlines and skeletons ; all the past is somehow grown dim . mary , girl ! thou fadest in pale glories behind me ; boy ! i seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue . strangest problems of life seem clearing ; but clouds sweep between -- is my journey \\' s end coming ? my legs feel faint ; like his who has footed it all day . feel thy heart ,-- beats it yet ? stir thyself , starbuck !-- stave it off -- move , move ! speak aloud !-- mast - head there ! see ye my boy \\' s hand on the hill ?-- crazed ;-- aloft there !-- keep thy keenest eye upon the boats :-- mark well the whale !-- ho ! again !-- drive off that hawk ! see ! he pecks -- he tears the vane \"-- pointing to the red flag flying at the main - truck --\" ha ! he soars away with it !-- where \\' s the old man now ? see \\' st thou that sight , oh ahab !-- shudder , shudder !\" the boats had not gone very far , when by a signal from the mast - heads -- a downward pointed arm , ahab knew that the whale had sounded ; but intending to be near him at the next rising , he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel ; the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence , as the head - beat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow . \" drive , drive in your nails , oh ye waves ! to their uttermost heads drive them in ! ye but strike a thing without a lid ; and no coffin and no hearse can be mine :-- and hemp only can kill me ! ha ! ha !\" suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles ; then quickly upheaved , as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice , swiftly rising to the surface . a low rumbling sound was heard ; a subterraneous hum ; and then all held their breaths ; as bedraggled with trailing ropes , and harpoons , and lances , a vast form shot lengthwise , but obliquely from the sea . shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist , it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air ; and then fell swamping back into the deep . crushed thirty feet upwards , the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains , then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes , leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale . \" give way !\" cried ahab to the oarsmen , and the boats darted forward to the attack ; but maddened by yesterday \\' s fresh irons that corroded in him , moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven . the wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead , beneath the transparent skin , looked knitted together ; as head on , he came churning his tail among the boats ; and once more flailed them apart ; spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates \\' boats , and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows , but leaving ahab \\' s almost without a scar . while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks ; and as the whale swimming out from them , turned , and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again ; at that moment a quick cry went up . lashed round and round to the fish \\' s back ; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which , during the past night , the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him , the half torn body of the parsee was seen ; his sable raiment frayed to shreds ; his distended eyes turned full upon old ahab . the harpoon dropped from his hand . \" befooled , befooled !\"-- drawing in a long lean breath --\" aye , parsee ! i see thee again .-- aye , and thou goest before ; and this , this then is the hearse that thou didst promise . but i hold thee to the last letter of thy word . where is the second hearse ? away , mates , to the ship ! those boats are useless now ; repair them if ye can in time , and return to me ; if not , ahab is enough to die -- down , men ! the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat i stand in , that thing i harpoon . ye are not other men , but my arms and my legs ; and so obey me .-- where \\' s the whale ? gone down again ?\" but he looked too nigh the boat ; for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore , and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage , moby dick was now again steadily swimming forward ; and had almost passed the ship ,-- which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him , though for the present her headway had been stopped . he seemed swimming with his utmost velocity , and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea . \" oh ! ahab ,\" cried starbuck , \" not too late is it , even now , the third day , to desist . see ! moby dick seeks thee not . it is thou , thou , that madly seekest him !\" setting sail to the rising wind , the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward , by both oars and canvas . and at last when ahab was sliding by the vessel , so near as plainly to distinguish starbuck \\' s face as he leaned over the rail , he hailed him to turn the vessel about , and follow him , not too swiftly , at a judicious interval . glancing upwards , he saw tashtego , queequeg , and daggoo , eagerly mounting to the three mast - heads ; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side , and were busily at work in repairing them . one after the other , through the port - holes , as he sped , he also caught flying glimpses of stubb and flask , busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances . as he saw all this ; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats ; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart . but he rallied . and now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the main - mast - head , he shouted to tashtego , who had just gained that perch , to descend again for another flag , and a hammer and nails , and so nail it to the mast . whether fagged by the three days \\' running chase , and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore ; or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him : whichever was true , the white whale \\' s way now began to abate , as it seemed , from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more ; though indeed the whale \\' s last start had not been so long a one as before . and still as ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him ; and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat ; and so continually bit at the plying oars , that the blades became jagged and crunched , and left small splinters in the sea , at almost every dip . \" heed them not ! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars . pull on ! \\' tis the better rest , the shark \\' s jaw than the yielding water .\" \" but at every bite , sir , the thin blades grow smaller and smaller !\" \" they will last long enough ! pull on !-- but who can tell \"-- he muttered --\" whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on ahab ?-- but pull on ! aye , all alive , now -- we near him . the helm ! take the helm ! let me pass ,\"-- and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat . at length as the craft was cast to one side , and ran ranging along with the white whale \\' s flank , he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance -- as the whale sometimes will -- and ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist , which , thrown off from the whale \\' s spout , curled round his great , monadnock hump ; he was even thus close to him ; when , with body arched back , and both arms lengthwise high - lifted to the poise , he darted his fierce iron , and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale . as both steel and curse sank to the socket , as if sucked into a morass , moby dick sideways writhed ; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow , and , without staving a hole in it , so suddenly canted the boat over , that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung , ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea . as it was , three of the oarsmen -- who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart , and were therefore unprepared for its effects -- these were flung out ; but so fell , that , in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again , and rising to its level on a combing wave , hurled themselves bodily inboard again ; the third man helplessly dropping astern , but still afloat and swimming . almost simultaneously , with a mighty volition of ungraduated , instantaneous swiftness , the white whale darted through the weltering sea . but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line , and hold it so ; and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats , and tow the boat up to the mark ; the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug , it snapped in the empty air ! \" what breaks in me ? some sinew cracks !--\\' tis whole again ; oars ! oars ! burst in upon him !\" hearing the tremendous rush of the sea - crashing boat , the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay ; but in that evolution , catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship ; seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions ; bethinking it -- it may be -- a larger and nobler foe ; of a sudden , he bore down upon its advancing prow , smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam . ahab staggered ; his hand smote his forehead . \" i grow blind ; hands ! stretch out before me that i may yet grope my way . is \\' t night ?\" \" the whale ! the ship !\" cried the cringing oarsmen . \" oars ! oars ! slope downwards to thy depths , o sea , that ere it be for ever too late , ahab may slide this last , last time upon his mark ! i see : the ship ! the ship ! dash on , my men ! will ye not save my ship ?\" but as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledge - hammering seas , the before whale - smitten bow - ends of two planks burst through , and in an instant almost , the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves ; its half - wading , splashing crew , trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water . meantime , for that one beholding instant , tashtego \\' s mast - head hammer remained suspended in his hand ; and the red flag , half - wrapping him as with a plaid , then streamed itself straight out from him , as his own forward - flowing heart ; while starbuck and stubb , standing upon the bowsprit beneath , caught sight of the down - coming monster just as soon as he . \" the whale , the whale ! up helm , up helm ! oh , all ye sweet powers of air , now hug me close ! let not starbuck die , if die he must , in a woman \\' s fainting fit . up helm , i say -- ye fools , the jaw ! the jaw ! is this the end of all my bursting prayers ? all my life - long fidelities ? oh , ahab , ahab , lo , thy work . steady ! helmsman , steady . nay , nay ! up helm again ! he turns to meet us ! oh , his unappeasable brow drives on towards one , whose duty tells him he cannot depart . my god , stand by me now !\" \" stand not by me , but stand under me , whoever you are that will now help stubb ; for stubb , too , sticks here . i grin at thee , thou grinning whale ! who ever helped stubb , or kept stubb awake , but stubb \\' s own unwinking eye ? and now poor stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft ; would it were stuffed with brushwood ! i grin at thee , thou grinning whale ! look ye , sun , moon , and stars ! i call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost . for all that , i would yet ring glasses with ye , would ye but hand the cup ! oh , oh ! oh , oh ! thou grinning whale , but there \\' ll be plenty of gulping soon ! why fly ye not , o ahab ! for me , off shoes and jacket to it ; let stubb die in his drawers ! a most mouldy and over salted death , though ;-- cherries ! cherries ! cherries ! oh , flask , for one red cherry ere we die !\" \" cherries ? i only wish that we were where they grow . oh , stubb , i hope my poor mother \\' s drawn my part - pay ere this ; if not , few coppers will now come to her , for the voyage is up .\" from the ship \\' s bows , nearly all the seamen now hung inactive ; hammers , bits of plank , lances , and harpoons , mechanically retained in their hands , just as they had darted from their various employments ; all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale , which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head , sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed . retribution , swift vengeance , eternal malice were in his whole aspect , and spite of all that mortal man could do , the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship \\' s starboard bow , till men and timbers reeled . some fell flat upon their faces . like dislodged trucks , the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bull - like necks . through the breach , they heard the waters pour , as mountain torrents down a flume . \" the ship ! the hearse !-- the second hearse !\" cried ahab from the boat ; \" its wood could only be american !\" diving beneath the settling ship , the whale ran quivering along its keel ; but turning under water , swiftly shot to the surface again , far off the other bow , but within a few yards of ahab \\' s boat , where , for a time , he lay quiescent . \" i turn my body from the sun . what ho , tashtego ! let me hear thy hammer . oh ! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine ; thou uncracked keel ; and only god - bullied hull ; thou firm deck , and haughty helm , and pole - pointed prow ,-- death - glorious ship ! must ye then perish , and without me ? am i cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains ? oh , lonely death on lonely life ! oh , now i feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief . ho , ho ! from all your furthest bounds , pour ye now in , ye bold billows of my whole foregone life , and top this one piled comber of my death ! towards thee i roll , thou all - destroying but unconquering whale ; to the last i grapple with thee ; from hell \\' s heart i stab at thee ; for hate \\' s sake i spit my last breath at thee . sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool ! and since neither can be mine , let me then tow to pieces , while still chasing thee , though tied to thee , thou damned whale ! thus , i give up the spear !\" the harpoon was darted ; the stricken whale flew forward ; with igniting velocity the line ran through the grooves ;-- ran foul . ahab stooped to clear it ; he did clear it ; but the flying turn caught him round the neck , and voicelessly as turkish mutes bowstring their victim , he was shot out of the boat , ere the crew knew he was gone . next instant , the heavy eye - splice in the rope \\' s final end flew out of the stark - empty tub , knocked down an oarsman , and smiting the sea , disappeared in its depths . for an instant , the tranced boat \\' s crew stood still ; then turned . \" the ship ? great god , where is the ship ?\" soon they through dim , bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom , as in the gaseous fata morgana ; only the uppermost masts out of water ; while fixed by infatuation , or fidelity , or fate , to their once lofty perches , the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea . and now , concentric circles seized the lone boat itself , and all its crew , and each floating oar , and every lance - pole , and spinning , animate and inanimate , all round and round in one vortex , carried the smallest chip of the pequod out of sight . but as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the indian at the mainmast , leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible , together with long streaming yards of the flag , which calmly undulated , with ironical coincidings , over the destroying billows they almost touched ;-- at that instant , a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air , in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar . a sky - hawk that tauntingly had followed the main - truck downwards from its natural home among the stars , pecking at the flag , and incommoding tashtego there ; this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood ; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill , the submerged savage beneath , in his death - gasp , kept his hammer frozen there ; and so the bird of heaven , with archangelic shrieks , and his imperial beak thrust upwards , and his whole captive form folded in the flag of ahab , went down with his ship , which , like satan , would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her , and helmeted herself with it . now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf ; a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides ; then all collapsed , and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago . epilogue \" and i only am escaped alone to tell thee \" job . the drama \\' s done . why then here does any one step forth ?-- because one did survive the wreck . it so chanced , that after the parsee \\' s disappearance , i was he whom the fates ordained to take the place of ahab \\' s bowsman , when that bowsman assumed the vacant post ; the same , who , when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat , was dropped astern . so , floating on the margin of the ensuing scene , and in full sight of it , when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me , i was then , but slowly , drawn towards the closing vortex . when i reached it , it had subsided to a creamy pool . round and round , then , and ever contracting towards the button - like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle , like another ixion i did revolve . till , gaining that vital centre , the black bubble upward burst ; and now , liberated by reason of its cunning spring , and , owing to its great buoyancy , rising with great force , the coffin life - buoy shot lengthwise from the sea , fell over , and floated by my side . buoyed up by that coffin , for almost one whole day and night , i floated on a soft and dirgelike main . the unharming sharks , they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths ; the savage sea - hawks sailed with sheathed beaks . on the second day , a sail drew near , nearer , and picked me up at last . it was the devious - cruising rachel , that in her retracing search after her missing children , only found another orphan .'"
