# NLP Projects

This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects demonstrating various NLP techniques and models.

## Project 1: Sentiment Analysis using Bag of Words

**Description:** Implemented a sentiment analysis model to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral using the Bag of Words technique.

**Technologies Used:**

*   Python
*   NLTK/spaCy
*   scikit-learn

**Key Outcomes/Achievements:**

*   Achieved [X]% accuracy on [Dataset Name, e.g., IMDB movie reviews].
*   Demonstrated understanding of text preprocessing techniques (e.g., tokenization, stemming/lemmatization) and feature extraction.

**Dataset:** [Link to dataset or description of how to obtain it]

## Project 2: Word Embeddings with CBOW and Word2Vec

**Description:** Implemented and compared CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words) and Word2Vec models to generate word embeddings and capture semantic relationships.

**Technologies Used:**

*   Python
*   Gensim
*   TensorFlow/PyTorch (if applicable)

**Key Outcomes/Achievements:**

*   Gained practical experience with word embedding techniques.
*   Visualized semantic relationships using dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., t-SNE).
*   [Optional: Mention if these embeddings were used in another project. E.g., "These embeddings were subsequently used to improve performance in a text classification task."]

## Project 3: Machine Translation using Transformers

**Description:** Developed a sequence-to-sequence machine translation model using the Transformer architecture.

**Technologies Used:**

*   Python
*   TensorFlow/PyTorch
*   Transformers library (Hugging Face Transformers)
*   [Dataset Name, e.g., WMT, IWSLT]

**Key Outcomes/Achievements:**

*   Implemented a Transformer-based translation model achieving [BLEU score or other metric, if available].
*   Demonstrated understanding of attention mechanisms and sequence-to-sequence modeling.

**Code:** [Link to code file/directory]

**Dataset:** [Link to dataset or description of how to obtain it]

## Project 4: Human vs. Machine Text Classification

**Description:** Developed and compared multiple models (Bag of Words, Multinomial Naive Bayes, BERT, and DistilBERT) to classify text generated by humans versus machines.

**Technologies Used:**

*   Python
*   scikit-learn
*   Transformers library (Hugging Face Transformers)
*   NLTK/spaCy

**Key Outcomes/Achievements:**

*   Compared the performance of traditional machine learning models with pre-trained language models, demonstrating the performance gains of transformers.
*   Achieved [X]% accuracy with BERT/DistilBERT.
*   Analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
